Games Den\r\n2. Quiz\r\n3. Pride Week\r\n4. Camera\r\n5. Boardgames storage.\r\n6. Code of Conduct / Demographics\r\n7. Constitution\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n### Reminders and Updates\r\n\r\n* **Society documents?** More on the constitution later! Risk assessment is waiting until Jakub's done with exams.\r\n* **Laser Quest?** All sorted, CompSoc is handling this. The event is up on Facebook!\r\n* **B2.02 Cupboards?** No progress, but with Callum (and now me) free of exams we can start to work on this again.\r\n* **Warhammer tourney?** Jon Cheah is looking into the Event Planning Pack - we may need to ticket if demand is high so that Dom can be paid and so that more terrain can be bought. Nigel should be around to run it, as should James SF. Dom is gathering interest to see if enough people will turn up for it to be worth running.\r\n* **How was UK Games Expo?** It was so good, we had a blast. More importantly Callum talked to Chaos Cards and gave them some business cards, so we'll see how that pans out.\r\n* **Asbestos?** At the time of the meeting there was a possibility that the Westwood store had asbestos so may have ruined our spare LARP kit, but the SU has contacted us now to say that isn't the case.\r\n\r\n### 1. Games Den\r\nAres, Alisdair and Benjamin went on a trip to meet with Tim from Games Den to formalise our deal with them. Two main points were brought up:\r\n\r\n* We can still get scores entered via their WER as long as we keep delivering them to him. We need to have a judge and Tournament Organiser known by Tim to do this (fortunately Alisdair and Ares fit the bill perfectly), although after the EGM if Ares is no longer our Draft Rep we'll need to introduce the new rep to Tim. Notably when we submit the results we get promos!\r\n* Buying boxes from Games Den is slightly more expensive than from Chaos Cards (\u00a383/84 a box vs \u00a375, but only as part of a crate). While we don't have to buy it from Games Den, we do get buy-a-box promos if we do so it is possibly worth it - we could pay the difference out of the budget sometimes (although it comes to \u00a354 a crate which is quite a lot of money) or increase draft prices when using those boxes. Ares is going to poll as to what the membership thinks.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, as long as we give them 3-5 weeks warning we can buy the relevant stuff and all is good.\r\n\r\n### 2. Quiz\r\nQuiz is coming up, which means rounds need to be written! The original plan was six rounds and a bonus round, however Callum and I have to be at Socs Awards (much less exciting than the quiz, but hey we might win) and John Humphreys is very busy so we're a few rounds short. Fortunately Jon Cheah has stepped in, Alisdair might be writing a round for Ares, Callum might write a round anyway and Ares has had a \"very John\" idea which they'll write. Basically, we good.\r\n\r\nThe exec have been asked to post quiz prize ideas in the Discord. Chaos Cards has some sick dealz at the moment so we'll look into prizes from them. Pocket Workshop should be able to provide trophies again, will talk to them about it after they've sorted the trophies for the Charity Cube next week.\r\n\r\n### 3. Pride Week\r\nPride Week is next week, so people should be around! Let's make sure all the events are sorted for the week:\r\n\r\n* **Charity Draft (Tuesday)**: cubes are built, trophies are in progress!\r\n* **Boardgaymes (Wednesday)**: catering hasn't replied about hot water for tea, but Thomas has a backup plan. Everything else is set. Ares has put up a Google Form for interest, please fill it in *especially* if you're making cake.\r\n* **Talks (Friday)**: H0.03 is booked from 5-7pm, Ares has snacks prepared.\r\n\r\n### 4. Camera\r\nWe previously discussed buying a camera for the society for advertising and LARP (see minutes from [way back in Term 2](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/262/), a calmer time). A couple of options were discussed back then, and a few general points were discussed about photos in general:\r\n\r\n* A camera could go on next year's budget!\r\n* Back when I was Comms, I had the issue of not knowing who had what photos and how to get them. To this end, we could use Google Photos for combining different people's sources of photos - this will be useful if we elect to not get a camera and stick with smartphones.\r\n* An aside brought up - we need to clean up Google Drive to make sure all the data on there should be up there. This will be discussed in a future meeting.\r\n\r\n### 5. Board Games Storage (also for LARP)\r\nWe may have some extra money due to the events we've run for RLT and others (Benjamin thinks \u00a3150 but will confirm this after exams), so Callum and I discussed boardgames storage: currently we have some broken boxes, one working suitcase, one suitcase with a broken wheel, a good bag and the semblance of another bag. We should replace some of these. LARP also has some broken boxes so would benefit too. Ideas considered:\r\n\r\n* **A trolley for carrying boxes**: sometimes we get unlucky with the timetable and have to move our stuff around, and a trolley would help. It would also mean we could buy more boxes than bags and suitcases and carry them around. This would have to be foldable as the trolley itself needs storing. Discussion was had about storing it in B2.01, but those cupboards are even more full.\r\n* **Boxes or bags**: cheaper, but we need to get heavy duty ones like those from Catering (these can be hard to carry though). Doesn't have to be translucent as we could label the box with its contents. Toolboxes could be a good thing to look out for.\r\n* **Suitcases**: could look in clearance, they don't have to be stylish. Ares has John Lewis contacts that could prove useful. Getting two smaller suitcases is better than one larger one for portability and because it's easier to break the large ones (they're heavier so take more damage when dropped).\r\n\r\nEither way, this should be done before the start of next year. We also need to sort the cupboards in general, they're a bit of a tip.\r\n\r\n### 6. Code of Conduct / Demographics\r\nA few points were brought up with regards to the Code of Conduct, which are being put on hold until Thomas is out of exam season. For reference, the points were:\r\n\r\n* A Code of Conduct was discussed at the Inclusivity training, which should be worked on before the new term. Who's writing it?\r\n* We should also get the opinions of the membership on this, can be merged into a general survey about how we can improve as a society (another point from the training). Who's sorting this?\r\n* We can get demographic information from the SU, which is useful for this Code of Conduct and improving the society in general. We should get this data!\r\n\r\nThis has been moved to the next meeting.\r\n\r\n### 7. Constitution\r\nCallum has finished exams, so has been editing the constitution. His efforts are on the Google Drive, so please read them and make comments! I will be cross referencing it with the SU's newly formatted Regulation 9 to make sure nothing important has been removed. We have until Wednesday 12th at 6pm to do this, so make your comments before then!\r\n\r\n## Next Meeting\r\nThe following will be discussed, with bracketed members focussed.\r\n\r\n1. Sponsorships *(Benjamin!)*\r\n2. Mini Socs Fair *(once the SU tells us when we're needed...)*\r\n3. Is there a proper way (in the SU's eyes) to do Draft? *(the new Draft Rep)*\r\n4. Tabletop extrav, and the question of who's gonna do the overnight shifts.\r\n5. Data security *(Thomas)*\r\n6. Code of Conduct / Demographics *(Thomas)*",

Lending games to other societies\r\n2. Sponsorships\r\n3. Games Den\r\n4. **Boardgaymes** and pride week (the squeakuel)\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n### Reminders and Updates\r\nBasically nothing has happened, we've been busy with exams - there has been no progress on society documents, laserquest, the cupboards or the Warhammer tournament. Hoodies have been sent off now (should be done by 6th June if everything is okay) and badges/statuettes should be available by the start of next week.\r\n\r\n### 1. Lending Games to Other Societies\r\nOur current system for lending games to other societies is that we ask for two of their exec to have membership. This is not ideal, because either they have to buy SocsFed (if they're a sports club) or they're only donating \u00a34 to us. We also ask them to advertise for us - after discussion with the society exec wanting to borrow the games, we provide a small bag of games for them to borrow along with some business cards, with the stickers on the games also advertising us. Should we change this? A short discussion lead to a \u00a310 flat fee being decided - now that we know that societies can transfer money between each other (we weren't sure of this in past discussions), this is an easy solution. This is now put into action, with the advertising stuff and the usual process (business cards and stickered games) staying as-is.\r\n\r\nAn important note: for the events we've run with the SU/RLT we've been paid \u00a350. This is different to lending games to other societies though as no society in their right mind is going to spend that much and for the SU/RLT events we help run the events as well, hence the increase in price. It's important to differentiate between these events and societies just borrowing our games!\r\n\r\n### 2. Sponsorships\r\nBack in Week 2, we discussed sponsorship options (see the relevant [meeting minutes](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/270/)). Benjamin went and drew up two systems - a tiers system and a packages system where you could buy advertising on our website, in the footer of the newsletter and so on - you can ask him if you want details. An indicative vote showed that some mix of the two (negotiable tiers) is probably most sensible, as tiers lack flexibility but are simple for companies to choose from. Regardless, once decided the system will be made public somehow (requires further discussion), but will not include the prices directly.\r\n\r\nCallum is also going to throw some business cards around at UK Games Expo (UKGE) and see if any companies are interested!\r\n\r\n### 3. Games Den\r\nWe have a deal with the Games Den that nobody really seems to have a strong idea about what it entails, so a group (Ares, Alisdair, Benjamin and probably some others) will go to Games Den to discuss and hopefully formalise our arrangement. This will aim to be done before UKGE, as Callum will attempt to talk to Wizards of the Coast with the aim of understanding if we can get the Wizards Event Reporter (WER) ourselves despite not being a shop. As an aside, Chaos Cards will be looked into as a sponsor in general (we buy sleeves from them among other things), and will be at UKGE as well.\r\n\r\n### 4. Boardgaymes and Pride Week\r\nLast week we discussed running Pride events during week 8. How's that going?\r\n\r\n* **Charity MTG Cube during Tuesday Draft**: in progress, is advertised and the money (buy-in costs) can go directly to the Equalitea donations since it's going to the same charity anyway. Prizes will be a Pocket Workshop trophy and a free buy-in to a future draft, a pack from a recent set to all those going 2-1, society die as a participation prize.\r\n* **Boardgaymes and Equalitea during Wednesday**: in progress. We have B2.02 from 1pm now, so will start it then. Ares is trying to get hot water canisters from catering for tea, and cake will definitely be made. Current roadblock: SU hasn't responded to the fundraising form.\r\n* **Talks**: Ares has a talk on gender, Matt Green has a talk on asexuality/aromanticism. We need to determine whether people would be interested, and if so this can run on the Friday.\r\n* **Any more events?** Finnbar might have a one-shot prepared by then, depends if they can get it done by then. The collection buckets should be present at all of our events.\r\n\r\n## Next Meeting\r\nThe following will be discussed, with bracketed members focussed.\r\n\r\n1. Games Den II: Electric Boogaloo *(At least one of the crew going to Games Den.)*\r\n2. Mini Societies Fair\r\n3. Budget III: The Summening *(Benjamin, also Josh if we talk about games storage.)*\r\n4. Survey about Code of Conduct *(Thomas)*\r\n5. Constitution *(Callum/Finnbar, the dynamic duo [citation needed])*\r\n6. Did anything cool happen at UK Games Expo? *(Callum/Finnbar, part of the UK Games Expo Sqwode)*\r\n\r\n## BONUS: Dragons\r\nImportant discussion was had as to how to characterise dragons. Please consult the slides about this important matter.",

Quiz\r\n2. Buying more advertising material for Socs Fair\r\n3. FAQs\r\n4. Something for Luke to collect cool stories with\r\n5. SU Training discussion\r\n6. **BOARDGAYMES**\r\n7. External announcements channel\r\n8. Serious channel\r\n9. General Discord moderation\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n### Reminders and Updates\r\n\r\n1. **Society Documents**: We're gonna submit the new Constitution once it's been EGM'd (Wed Week 9). The Memorandum is in Callum's bag. Risk Assessment yet to exist.\r\n2. **Socs Awards Nominations Complete!** *(After Meeting Note: Hey, we actually got shortlisted.)*\r\n3. **Laserquest with CompSoc**: Messaged CompSoc's social sec, will run Tuesday Week 9.\r\n4. **B2.02 Cupboards**: Responsibility has transferred to Callum and Finnbar.\r\n5. **Badges and statuettes are still on sale!** If you look at slide three of the meeting slides you can see a good meme,\r\n6. **Hoodie orders**: Since the meeting, they've been sent off.\r\n\r\n### 1. Quiz\r\nThe quiz is Week 9 Thursday evening (same time as Socs Awards >:( ), and Ares is hosting. Ares is taking one round - volunteers for the rest of the rounds were Callum, Thomas, Anakin, Luke and Jon Bell. Ten questions, please don't make the scoring stupid. Most importantly, Scottish John will probably do a bonus round, hell yeah.\r\n\r\n### 2. Socs Fair Advertising\r\nMini Socs Fair is **Friday 21st** and **Saturday 22nd June, 9-5** (or at least one of them depending on what the SU decides). We need advertising material!\r\n\r\n* **Business Cards**: We have many of the generic ones left from previous fairs.\r\n* **Posters**: We have an A5 and an A4 one. Ares will print a bunch more of the A5 ones (on a generic printer, so free).\r\n* **Pin Board**: We have access to a pin board - Ares will legitimately acquire a laminator and laminate various logos, event posters and photos to stick up on it. They'll also look into a society flag. We might also have the D&D rainbow flag but that's unlikely to arrive on time.\r\n* **Logo Statue**: Will be \u00a320, Benjamin will see if that's feasible. I'll get measurements.\r\n\r\nWe'll do a sign up sheet for this, remembering that the Megagame is on the Friday so we'll have limited exec around then.\r\n\r\n### 3. FAQ\r\nThe FAQ is available but unlinked for the moment on the [website](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/page/faq/), but is a bit long. Luke is in charge of cutting this down to a reasonable size that doesn't duplicate the website description. Thanks Luke! Callum also suggested maybe putting the full FAQ as a PDF (including the questions to be culled) but we thought it wouldn't be read. Once the ~~ritual~~ cull is complete it'll be linked to on the front page!\r\n\r\n### 4. Something For Luke To Collect Cool Stories With\r\nLuke would like a way to collect cool stories from events he's missed, for he cannot go to every single event we run *(ex-Comms Officer interjection: lightweight :P )*. Fortunately two ideas were presented and put into motion:\r\n\r\n* A message at the top of the newsletter to the effect of \"Did a cool thing at one of our events? Contact us and it might be featured next week!\"\r\n* A Discord channel for cool stories. #highlights\r\n\r\n### 5. SU Training Discussion\r\nVarious exec went to the relevant training. Socs Forum happened (notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZMbh3ZPXYxks1IQ4_XPCFVoPUM56iIdcuBHmzmY9dg/edit?usp=sharing)), as did Welfare training, but many useful points were made during the Inclusivity Workshop attended by Benjamin and Ares. It ended up being a discussion so lots of useful points that could be done by the society were raised. Let's a-go:\r\n\r\n1. An anonymous poll of our membership asking for feedback and suggestions. Apparently the SU have our demographic details which we can access (Thomas will investigate). We can run such a poll at the end of term three.\r\n2. We could run a buddying scheme for Fresher's Week - existing members offer to be a buddy to a nervous fresher, play games etc.\r\n3. To get more people to run for exec, get members to do small exec-like tasks, such as GMing an RPG or helping run boardgames. *(After meeting note by Callum: bring in members to help run events as an assistant.)*\r\n4. Apparently we get a weekly email from the Societies Officer, but I've never seen it...\r\n5. You can go to specific SU officers for specific issues.\r\n6. Make a code of conduct and stick it on the door of events!\r\n7. Apparently you can elect multiple welfare officers, which is kind of what we've got now that Equal Ops doesn't entirely exist. Might be good to try and get a non-male Welfare Officer in our next exec (or from outside the exec).\r\n8. For wellbeing needs we can refer people to the advice centre upstairs in the SU, which the SU is working on centralising.\r\n9. Keep people aware that they can join the society whenever!\r\n10. Could frequently print out A5 schedules (just generic printouts), along with links to the site.\r\n\r\nThe Welfare training also provided some action-by-action points on inclusivity, which is useful to follow.\r\n\r\n### 6. Board**gay**mes\r\nPride month is June, and there was much discussion about running special events for that week! It was concluded that it would be run in week 8, and needs to be more than just renaming the events. Running a charity Magic Cube Draft was mentioned, but otherwise we need to think of other events to run (if you're reading this and have an idea, let us know).\r\n\r\nEquali**tea** was also mentioned and will be run during Board**gay**mes in Week 8 - this is a Stonewall fundraising event where people buy tea and cake. Ares has briefly discussed this with Sam in the SU, and we can possibly get free hot water canisters from them. Discussion was had about moving board**gay**mes to be earlier so we have cake from midday (people are more likely to buy cake then), but people there from 2 might miss out due to hungry lunchtime cake purchasers. This is a decision to be made closer to the time.\r\n\r\nAres could also do their talk on gender identity (they did one for Physics Postgrads) again, but there isn't really a best day for this. They'll try to determine interest. Finally, there's a schedule on slide 11 for the end of this term, and it looks very busy.\r\n\r\n### 7. External Announcements Channel\r\nThere was discussion on having an #external-announcements channel on the Discord for events we'd like to publicise but don't run. This includes LGBT+ events and LANs. We considered having it as a footer in the newsletter (this was in fact suggested at the Inclusivity Training), but the newsletter footer is already quite large so a Discord channel was suggested.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the main aim is to show we're supportive and inclusive, and could lead to us going to events as a society.\r\n\r\n* **Who manages it?** Ares doesn't mind running it, Luke is happy to promote events in the newsletter when asked.\r\n* **How do we implement it?** Two options were considered.\r\n\t* **Locked so only exec can post, and make it clear you can contact exec to get stuff advertised.** Could be seen as us promoting only events we like, but this is fine as it's our space to promote stuff. Must pass events by the rest of the exec before promoting them.\r\n\t* **Open, with very strict rules and moderation.** Difficult to moderate, not uniform.\r\n\t* We voted on it: 8 for locked, 0 for open, 2 abstain, 0 for no channel at all. Thomas will carry this out.\r\n\r\n### 8. Serious Channel\r\nDiscussion was had about having #serious, for serious discussion. Should this exist in our society Discord?\r\n\r\n* It could promote arguing, but also moves possibly difficult conversations away from more general channels and into ones only people who want to have serious discussions are in.\r\n* Our server isn't really the place for this kind of debate - it's for lighthearted tabletop content, and we don't have the responsibility to provide this space.\r\n* Some people in the server are trying to avoid serious matters altogether.\r\n* The argument breaking out was independent of a serious channel, it was just people talking about a current event - but it's difficult to distinguish between discussion on current events and #serious.\r\n\r\nWe also discussed the different ways it could be implemented.\r\n\r\n1. A doormat channel with a pinned post explaining how to join a secret channel.\r\n2. A secret channel explained in the rules.\r\n3. Open which is read only only once opted into.\r\n4. Open.\r\n5. We don't implement it at all.\r\n\r\nThere was a vote on whether #serious should exist: 0 for, 6 against, 2 abstain (some exec members had to leave the meeting early). There was also discussion on whether #off-topic-and-shitposting should be split into two channels so #off-topic could be used for discussion of current events, the vote for this was 7 for, 0 against, 3 abstain.\r\n\r\n### 9. Discord Moderation\r\nWe currently have every exec essentially acting as moderators of the Discord, which can lead to problems as different exec handle things differently. How do we make moderation more consistent?\r\n\r\n#### Points to Discuss\r\n1. Have a few assigned mods from within exec - more consistent, but pushes pressure on a few people when these things happen.\r\n2. Have a very specific set of guidelines to follow when moderating. How do we define these?\r\n3. Could add to rules?\r\n4. What happens if another exec is out of line?\r\n\r\n#### Discussion and Votes\r\n1. Do these have to be from exec? Could link into idea from earlier of getting members involved so they run for exec. Could also promote those mods to the exec channel on the Society Discord. Thomas can be head moderator in that sense. Any mod should notify all others if they are going to deal with an issue so there aren't conflicts. Mod should have priority, but exec can still try to solve issues in worst case. Vote on full members joining mods happening: 9 for, 0 against, 1 abstain.\r\n2. Code of Conduct links into this easily. Poll members as to what they'd like in said code (what would you like to change in the society?). We need to include procedures as well. Also need to be careful with too many people complaining about it being out of line (pouncing on them). In the end, let a moderator claim and sort it, and try to avoid members joining in. People make mistakes, both parties need to be careful.\r\n3. Rewrite with respect to mod changes and Code of Conduct. \"If you see a mod dealing with an issue, don't join in\".\r\n4. To be dealt with within exec, probably as a small meeting (Pres, Welfare, Equal Ops) first.\r\n\r\n## Next Meeting\r\nThe following will be discussed, with bracketed members focussed.\r\n\r\n1. Brief discussion on what we charge for board games. *(Josh, Benjamin)*\r\n2. Sponsorship *(Benjamin)*\r\n3. Socs Fair logistics *(Ares with respect to advertising)*\r\n4. More boardgaymes *(Ares)*",

If you'd like to be there to discuss a certain point or would like your concerns discussed, simply talk to a member of exec - they will let you know where the meeting is or will bring your thoughts forward.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n### Exec Present\r\nFinnbar (Secretary)\r\nCallum (President)\r\nThomas (Web Admin)\r\nJon Bell (RPGs)\r\nJon Cheah (Wargames)\r\nBenjamin (Treasurer)\r\nJosh (Boardgames)\r\nJakub (LARP)\r\nDaniel (Draft)\r\nLuke (Comms)\r\nAnakin (Assistant RPG)\r\nNigel (Holiday / RLT Contact)\r\nAres (Graphic Design)\r\n\r\n### Exec Absent\r\nTim (Quartermaster, with a broken shoulder)\r\nAlisdair (CCGs Rep, waiting on an Amazon parcel)\r\n\r\n### Orders Of Business\r\n\r\n1. RLT board games\r\n2. Warhammer tourney guy\r\n3. Discussion on sponsorship packages/levels.\r\n4. Local game store (LGS) stuff.\r\n5. What's Thomas Been Up To This Holiday? (Web Admin Update)\r\n6. Formatting of subscribable calendars.\r\n7. The Great British Badge-Off, also including hoodies and statuettes.\r\n8. RPG intro paragraphs on site (and FAQs).\r\n9. Discussion of training if time.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n### Reminders and Updates\r\n\r\n1. **Society documents**: Memorandum is done, exec sheet is done and definitely handed in, constitution and risk assessment are in progress.\r\n2. **Socs awards**: The deadline is 3rd May, so we need to get on with this. If you want to do an individual application, go for it!\r\n3, **SU page / website description?**: I finally finished writing it! (Thanks for your help Ares.)\r\n4. **Megagame**: is now definitely on the 21st, exec were already planning to be there, and we have a room so all is good.\r\n5. **Laserquest**: no progress, but will likely be Week 9 Tuesday (as discounts are on Tuesdays and week 10 is bad for CompSoc).\r\n6. **B2.02 cupboards?**: no progress, but Callum and Nigel will meet to discuss this. *(After meeting update: this happened.)*\r\n\r\n### 1. RLT Board Games\r\n#### Info\r\n\r\n* This was organised on Discord - it's running 11th May (Saturday Week 3) from 3-9pm.\r\n* We're getting paid \u00a350 for this.\r\n* The advertising has been done (Nigel emailed 600 people, so I expect his sent box is quite angry at him) - posters were made and the event was mentioned at kitchen meetings. Apparently last year only 20-30 people turned up but the advertising was bad, so we could be expecting more - but the MSB rooms around the room we've got are mostly free so we can borrow furniture if needed.\r\n* There maybe should be a discussion in future about how much we charge for societies borrowing our stuff. (This is a discussion point for next meeting.)\r\n\r\n#### Questions\r\n\r\n* **How are we getting games there?** The warden has a car, and enough exec can drive anyway. We can carry stuff if needed.\r\n* **Who's going to be there?** Exec that can be around: Finnbar, Thomas, Benjamin, Luke, Jon (Wargames), Josh, Anakin - I'll sort out a Doodle for this soon.\r\n\r\n### 2. Warhammer Guy\r\n#### Info / To Discuss\r\n\r\n* There's a postgrad who wants to run a Warhammer tournament *(it turns out this is for June/July **2020**)* and would like us to book a room and borrow terrain.\r\n* We have some issues about this:\r\n\t* How okay is it that he wants to charge for this event?\r\n\t* Why does he need us in the first place, when he could just book the room himself? We have liability if we're organising.\r\n\t* He mentioned charging for food and prep, but he can't advertise charging for food due to Room Bookings rules.\r\n* Jon and I were considering meeting with him in person to ask these questions, but couldn't arrange anything before next Friday.\r\n\r\n#### Discussion / Actions\r\n\r\n* We need to work out whether this is an actual collaboration between him and us, or him just borrowing our resources. (This matters for liability, who's organising, etc.)\r\n* Is this an event we're hosting for the benefit of the local area? We need to talk to James Sampson-Foster more about the previous event.\r\n* We should really be organising this because of liability, but he can definitely be Tournament Organiser.\r\n* Jon and I will definitely meet with him soon.\r\n\r\n### 3. Sponsorships and Stuff\r\n#### Info / To Discuss\r\n\r\n* How do we formalise our sponsorships? We have lots of advertising space (at events, social media) that could be used well.\r\n* Do we need a formal \"sponsorship package\" to show to potential sponsors? (The SU have some slides on this.)\r\n* Do we split up our sponsorships into tiers (tiers from mentions on social media all the way up to mentions at events) or just have them be called \"generous benefactors\" in a unified tier?\r\n* How do we approach sponsorships in general? We\u2019ve been lucky with Zatu in that they approached us, but that\u2019s not an effective way to continue to get sponsorships.\r\n\r\n#### Discussion\r\n\r\n* We could allow sponsorship of specific events, e.g. Tabletop Weekend. This can be difficult however as corporations can be slow to reply. It could be lots of work for less rewards - we have to advertise the effect of those specific events rather than just ourselves.\r\n* These companies need to be somewhat relevant (and preferably non-dubious) - however, the most relevant companies are likely to only give us discounts on their stuff like Zatu.\r\n* Employer sponsors are good because of our demographics (we're mostly STEM) and can open up options. These require a census of what people at Tabletop study, however, and this requires data protection and many responses to actually be a trustworthy statistic for employers.\r\n* Sponsors could support prizes for the quiz and similar, like CompSoc's WASD prizes.\r\n* We had some tiers of sponsorship a while ago which were kind of hastily put together, and these accidentally promoted a bidding war (\"they've got silver sponsorship? We want gold!\") which was profitable.\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n\r\n* We really need a \"want to sponsor us?\" message on the site! *(After meeting note: this has been done.)*\r\n* Benjamin will draft some stuff up, which will be discussed in a future meeting.\r\n\r\n### 4. Local Game Stores\r\n\r\nAlisdair was in conversation with Big Orbit Games, who were very happy to work with us with regards to WER and other Magic tournament things. Unfortunately according to Wizards of the Coast we're too far away for this to work, so we've had to abandon it. Daniel and Alisdair are going to go back to Games Den to discuss the deal we had and hopefully sort things out.\r\n\r\n### 5. \"What's Thomas been up to this holiday?\" a new chat show featuring Thomas, our Web Admin, and the work he has done over this holiday\r\n\r\n#### What did Thomas implement this holiday?\r\n\r\n* Database was migrated.\r\n* Email template was reformatted and shrunk.\r\n* Email notifications and notification settings in general were added.\r\n* Improved Markdown editing on mobile.\r\n* A new timetable system.\r\n* Image and file uploads without having to log directly into the server.\r\n* Inventory system for seeing our board game collection and borrowing from it.\r\n* Old pages moved to a new system.\r\n* Bug fixes and general cleanup.\r\n\r\n#### What needs doing now?\r\n\r\n* The Privacy Policy needs to be updated as we now use people's email addresses.\r\n* Code changes need to be checked. *(After meeting note: Done.)*\r\n* Email template column maybe squished, but had to be done like that because there's no good way to fix it. (Basically responsive design on web email clients is awful.)\r\n* Newsletter no longer needs to be sent out by the SU site! (ex-Comms Officer voice) THANK GOODNESS OH MY GOD THAT SENDER IS SO BAD. *(After meeting note: It will need to be used a little longer.)*\r\n* Who's updating the inventory? Thomas initially. LARP stuff should probably be inventoried, board games definitely, RPGs hopefully, includes suggestions for things.\r\n* We need trackable accounts because real names aren't always linked to accounts - having first/last names optional on sign up would be good - Thomas has a plan for that.\r\n* There was polite applause.\r\n\r\n### 6. Calendar Formatting\r\n#### Info / To Discuss\r\n\r\n* We\u2019re adding subscribable calendars to the website with all of our events on them! How do we arrange them though?\r\n\t* One calendar for all of our events. Means only subscribing once, but you get notified for every event and they don't come up in different colours.\r\n\t* One calendar per event (maybe not RPGs) and a calendar for special events. Requires many subscriptions, but reduces unnecessary notifications and can be in different colours.\r\n* In the latter case, where do events such as RPG Intros go - in special events, in RPGs, or in both? Same issue for postgrad board games. \r\n\r\n#### Discussion / Actions\r\n\r\n* Having events in multiple calendars is not ideal, because of how conflicts are rendered.\r\n* Might be able to look into smaller text on the website for one calendar per event? Otherwise it's a lot of text - two long links per calendar leads to a very long page.\r\n* **Conclusion**: We're going for one calendar per event (not RPGs), and a general special events calendar (for all special events, regardless of faction alignment).\r\n\r\n### 7. The Great British Badge-Off, also including hoodies and statuettes\r\n\r\nYou can now buy these - thanks Ares/Benjamin! Soon we'll do a super cute promo photo shoot reminding people to buy the badges. There's been discussion of an ally specific badge with a watermark, which has now been mocked up and put online. Reminders: hoodies are on sale until 5th May, badges and friends are up until 12th May. (Luke will get announcements out about those.) Please put funny answers for what you're gonna do as ruler of Britain.\r\n\r\n### 8. RPG Intro Data / FAQ\r\n\r\n* Niamh (ran for Assistant RPG Rep) would like introductory paragraphs about each of the different RPGs run in the society, and Jon (RPGs) agrees.\r\n* **Who's writing these?** Various DM/GMs.\r\n* **Where do they go?** Via a link on the events page.\r\n\r\nJon is sorting this. Luke has been added to the DMs chat so he can see and publicise games. FAQ discussion moved to next meeting.\r\n\r\n### 9. Discussion of Training (if time)\r\nThere wasn't time.\r\n\r\n## Next Meeting\r\nThe following will be discussed, with bracketed members focussed.\r\n\r\n1. Various Discord things - #serious, #external-announcements, moderation in general. *(Thomas)*\r\n2. More on FAQs. *(Thomas, Jon (RPGs))*\r\n3. SU training discussion. *(Benjamin, Ares)*\r\n4. A Discord channel for cool things that happened. *(Luke)*\r\n5. Brief discussion on what we charge for board games. *(Benjamin, Josh)*\r\n6. Boardgaymes and Equalitea *(Ares)*",

You enter the silent room, lit by only a pair of weak fluorescent lights hung from the ceiling. There's a little art and a few posters about astrophysics on the walls. A stuffed shark is sat in a chair, silently but adorably judging you. A lightless window can be seen on the far wall, covered by a black and white picture of what seems like a prison concourse.

Nigel, please continue to pester.\r\n2. **Lazer quest update (Nigel)**: CompSoc are happy to do late term 3. They\u2019re discussing it.\r\n3. **Compsoc boardgames update?**: None.\r\n4. **SU website description updates?**: None.\r\n5. **Introducing roles to the Discord (as per Benjamin\u2019s motion) - who?**: Thomas, working with Benji and maybe talking to Chaotic Tim.\r\n6. **Wallplanner deadline is next Monday - what are we promoting and who\u2019s doing it?**: Tabletop Day maybe, depending on discussion with the medics. Extrav should be on there. Finnbar needs to do this. *[After the meeting note: wallplanner event sent.]*\r\n7. **Exec photos - does anyone not want one on the website?**: Jon Bell and Chaotic Tim.\r\n8. **We have a bunch of fun documents to sort (Memorandum, Constitution) - who?**: Callum and Finnbar. Can probably just copy the memorandum.\r\n9. **Apparently welcome week events are due soon??**: Nathan look into that **ASAP**.\r\n\r\n### 1. Camera Reprisal Reprisal\r\nNo more research was done on this, so it has been moved to next term.\r\n\r\n### 2. The Teachings of the Old Exec\r\n#### Using the Banner Correctly\r\nPatrick wanted to show us all how to use the banner correctly, so did this. 7/10, it was a'ight.\r\n\r\n#### How To SU Good\r\nIf you need a contact, our Societies Coordinator is Indy. He can be found in the SUHQ Resources Room.\r\n\r\n* **Online Money Request Forms**: they can be found on the admin pane of the SU site (click your name, then \"Tabletop Games and Roleplaying Society\") under Finances. **Keep your invoices/receipts.**\r\n* **Members Lists**: can be found in the admin pane as well. For handing out dice we have a members list of those who have got dice - go to Groups > Dice (potential members are those that haven't got one yet).\r\n\r\n### 3. Working With Local Stores\r\n#### To Discuss\r\n1. Jon: Gigante update?\r\n2. Alisdair: update on local stores with WER?\r\n3. James S-F: anything to say about Escape Games?\r\n4. We should keep track of our relations with companies\u2026\r\n5. Sponsorships for next year?\r\n6. Wizards???\r\n\r\n#### Actions/Results\r\n1. We put the code up (Facebook, Wargames Group, Newsletter), they now are asking about whether our members would be interested in some specific product? Jon is on it.\r\n2. Ares will talk to Alisdair, we\u2019ll discuss this in future.\r\n3. We need to decide who\u2019s the representative of the society in the eyes of Escape. James S-F will talk to whoever is chosen (choose before Sept). Still worth looking into, although Zatu might overshadow them now. **Anakin has been chosen.**\r\n4. Benjamin is going to make a record of what our relations are with companies at the moment.\r\n5. Trifecta (Pres, Sec, Treas) and Luke should look into this.\r\n6. Daniel look into this please.\r\n\r\n### 4. Badges, Patches and Other Things That Say \"Exec\" on them\r\n#### Badges\r\nPocket Workshop now have a badge press and were offering \u00a31 badges - could be good for showing exec roles when it\u2019s too warm for a hoodie. *[Your friendly secretary and non-binary person's important interjection: Also pronouns yay!]*\r\n\r\nThis is great! Could also do badges with pronouns and rainbow logo for members, hell yeah. Could also have badges per society faction? Good luck Ares, you've got a lot of drawing to do.\r\nRegardless, these would be bought by individuals not the society. Finnbar needs to investigate exact pricing (all same design for bulk discount?).\r\n\r\n#### Patches / Enamel Pins\r\nPatches were also discussed - could be embroidered onto hoodies so returning exec that change roles don\u2019t have to buy a new one every year. *[Finnbar cries relatably]*\r\n\r\nIssue pointed out by Ares: Patches and enamel pins are... not great because you have to order 100+ of the same design and it\u2019s really expensive (so not useful for personalisation).\r\n\r\n#### Logo Statue\r\nWe can get a huge version of the trophies from the last quiz from Pocket Workshop for \u00a320 - could be good for socs fair table?\r\n\r\nPatrick thinks it's silly - not enough space on socs fair table. Nigel had an idea about (literally) elevating our logo - so it's above everything else so is easy to see. Ares has ideas mentioned in Handover doc (on ~~order~~ page 66).\r\nIt would be nice to have, could replace the usual central poster in the display. Surround it with wargs minis. Could go for a smaller one? I'll (Finnbar) look into exact sizing.\r\n\r\n### 5. Arranging Future Exec Meetings\r\nCurrently when organising exec meetings:\r\n\r\n* A Facebook group post goes out with topics and who\u2019s focussed\r\n* Focussed members get a Doodle poll, best dates chosen from that.\r\n* Everyone else gets the Doodle, remaining exec fill it out.\r\n* Date is chosen, room booked.\r\n* Cry at room bookings.\r\n\r\nThis is slow and time consuming, so alternatives were considered:\r\n\r\n* **Skip having a separate focussing poll altogether, but still focus and pick times that suit those focussed.** This has worked in the past.\r\n* **Have a weekly/fortnightly meeting time.** This could leave some exec unable to attend meetings for an entire term. Also absolutely not during term 3, exams aaaaaa. Could try to send a doodle before term starts to see if there fortunately is a time? Will trial term 1 next year. Also avoids room bookings, nice.\r\n* **Run meetings in the evening.** Evenings aren\u2019t great because they clash with one of our events or is a Friday - so we'll need someone to cover every week/fortnight.\r\n* **Weekends?** Not great as RPGs and LARP exist. Still worthwhile for emergency meetings, but if a weekly slot is made on a Saturday morning for example we all lose our Saturday mornings.\r\n\r\n### 6. Pocket Workshop Selling Trophies\r\nMembers have asked Pocket Workshop about buying extra trophies from the quiz off of them. Issues to consider:\r\n\r\n* It possibly makes quiz prizes less exciting as you can just buy them now.\r\n* Leavers might want a memento from the society though.\r\n\r\nSolutions were proposed to differentiate between the trophies being sold from the ones being won:\r\n\r\n* Different colours? Different size? (Could talk to Pocket Workshop about this.)\r\n* Could add \"quiz winner [date]\" engraving onto actual quiz prizes.\r\n* Could make them not detachable.\r\n\r\nThe following was proposed by Patrick:\r\n\r\nQuiz trophies should be made more special with engraving, allow sale of normal ones through the society (rather than on Pocket Workshop's site). No alterations to what Pocket Workshop sells are necessary. We're supporting the company, not trying to restrict them. Could even have termly sales!\r\n\r\nThis was voted on and was unanimously approved bar one abstention. *[After the meeting: Pocket Workshop were happy with this!]*\r\n\r\n### 7. Quiz Prize Responsibility\r\n#### What Prizes?\r\nBuying prizes for all parts of the society is hard (sorry LARP), especially as the winning team might not have a Magic player or a Wargamer among them. Discussion on this:\r\n\r\n* In previous years James S-F has just turned up to Escape (generally convenient!) and cut a deal.\r\n* Notably prizes haven't always been split between all factions (in fact, in initial quizzes this split wasn't considered, this has just become a thing).\r\n* Boardgames are a good universal prize. Pocket Workshop mini packs might be good?\r\n* Stuff from sponsors / vouchers? (honestly though that's a lot less fun)\r\n\r\n#### Who Prizes?\r\nWho should be responsible for getting the quiz prizes?\r\n\r\nPatrick: Should spread responsibility of finding prizes, so CCGs rep suggests CCGs prizes and the like, then one person buys them all (otherwise that's a lot of money request forms).\r\nJames S-F: Maybe the Escape Games liaison should do it because that's worked well - the staff there have even suggested what to buy in the past.\r\n\r\n### 8. Holiday Room Bookings\r\n#### To Discuss\r\n1. At the AGM merging the holiday events was discussed. Are we doing that for this holiday?\r\n2. Who's booking the rooms, and what rooms?\r\n3. Also some PG Boardgames issues came up.\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n1. People tend to be around for the Easter events (cries in exams), so larger attendance is likely. Nigel will talk to the other Wargamers, but for now we'll stick with three separate events.\r\n2. Bookings will be made for all three events. Finnbar will talk to Ares about this, it\u2019ll probably be Finnbar\u2019s job. *[After the meeting note: it's done.]*\r\n3. The posters for our Dirty Duck event don't mention the society at all. Also, we've not received compensation for recent events, what's the deal with that? Nigel will investigate.\r\n\r\n### 9. Budget Reprise\r\nAt the last meeting the cushion for draft and the CCGs budget were reduced. Nathan, is everything calm again now?\r\n\r\n* Everything is now fine. (entire room: \"yay!\")\r\n* Don't go over your current budgets at all. The budget refreshes in September.\r\n* Benjamin needs to keep an eye out for the budget form coming out soon.\r\n\r\n### 10. Megagame\r\n#### Info / To Discuss\r\n1. The PDF was bought by myself and Callum, we now have all the material and as organisers will sort the running of the game.\r\n2. Rooms situation is interesting - can get a few Oculus rooms or part of the Science Concourse. Need to decide a day to run this.\r\n3. SU has ticketing which can\u2019t be started until three weeks after forms have been filled in. Non-members can buy tickets and be charged differently to members. Need to make a budget - with \u00a35 tickets (way less than a normal megagame) we can buy nice things like food and a big map.\r\n4 We did a survey to gauge interest!\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\n1. Yay, we even have a discord now.\r\n2. Sports places are \u00a345 an hour, so probably not ideal. Look into GLT3 (Luke\u2019s on it), which could work really well. *[After the meeting note: Luke did look into it, but alas GLT3 is being renovated starting from week 8 next term. Thanks anyway, Luke!]*\r\n\t1. Term 3 vs term 1 - issue is that every society/friendship group is organising stuff term 3 weeks 9-10. Would still be nice to run it as practice though!\r\n\t2. Proposal: Wed Week 9, instead of boardgames. Will ask members at boardgames if they're okay with this. Maybe have a second poll or general \"is it okay to not have boardgames once\". **Could have boardgames start at 5.** Otherwise could do Thursday Week 9. Callum will book for both ASAP.\r\n3. Good, but need to sort the financial planner ASAP. *[After the meeting note: this has been done and handed into the SU along with the other relevant documents.]*\r\n4. 25 positive responses so far! So definitely enough to run it.\r\n\r\nNigel ended with the following important quote about the megagame: \"it sounds like a murder mystery, except the person being murdered is the Earth\".\r\n\r\n## Next Meeting\r\nThe following should be discussed with the bracketed members focussed.\r\n\r\n1. Camera reprisal reprisal reprisal? *(Jakub/Tim)*\r\n2. Please contact Thomas about website changes, including the new draft schedule. *(Thomas, to probably summarise to the exec the changes he made.)*\r\n3. International Tabletop Day *(Callum, as his first serious Presidential duty)*\r\n4. RPG introduction posts *(Jon (RPGs))*",

SU website description updates?\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n1. No update\r\n2. Compsoc were enquiring about this - Nigel still needs to check with them about doing this later during term 3\r\n3. No update on that\r\n4. Nothing yet\r\n\r\n**1. Appointed Exec**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\nWe need to fill the following roles:\r\n\r\n1. Health and Safety Officer\r\n2. Equal Opportunities Officer\r\n3. Welfare Officer\r\n---\r\n4. Graphic Design Officer\r\n5. Holiday Officer\r\n---\r\n6. Any other assistant reps\r\n    a. LARPG Rep? This has the issue of as much if not more jobs than an elected exec member.\r\n    b. LARP already has enough reps\r\n    c. RPG does really need an assistant rep\r\n    d. Nigel: maybe boardgames would benefit from an assistant rep? Especially in the first few weeks of term. Patrick: fellow exec already helped with that. Adding another rep would bloat the exec.\r\n\r\n*Nominations (votes for in brackets. Highest vote wins.):*\r\n\r\n1. Health and Safety: **Jakub (10)**\r\n2.

Budget Reminder (Nathan)**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n* Is the form going to be the same as last time? If so, Reps should start thinking about their budget for the coming year and specific examples of things they want to buy - Nigel\r\n* Large payment unexpectedly appeared for the website\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n* No notice of it changing but socs council might announce this\r\n    * New exec start thinking about your next year budget!\r\n* Talked about budget on the Super Sexy Budget Sheet, and found some rearranging that needed to be made\r\n* Task for Nathan: update the budget, feedback next week\r\n* Chaos cards account: change email from Daniel\u2019s to the new reps and keep this account for society purchases\r\n\r\n**5.0. Handover**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n1. If you haven\u2019t already, good idea to have an informal 1-1 meeting with the old exec in your area to chat about stuff\r\n2. Constitution: needs reworking and then ratifying by the SU. Who will be responsible?\r\n3. Tagarople google drive! Contains almost everything, and it\u2019s important for you new exec to use it!!\r\n4. Almost everything is written up in the handover document\r\n    a. There are some sections missing from the document, and some sections that may need moving around - up to the new exec to now do this (but remember you can consult the old exec and get their help)\r\n    b. This will be discussed next\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n1. -\r\n2. Constitution responsibility: Pres (Callum) and Sec (Finnbar)\r\n    a. I need to send you the spelling/grammar errors I picked up so you can fix them too.\r\n3. Any old exec: upload any bits that should be in the drive.\r\n    a. I\u2019ll work on uploading past quiz rounds and advertisement bits over Easter.\r\n    b. I need to add Anakin and Joshua S to the FB group\r\n4. Homework for new exec: read the appropriate sections of the handover doc (this isn\u2019t just your section! Read the events and stuff too!)\r\n\r\n**5.1. Handover Logistics**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n1. I\u2019ve created a checklist of accounts/passwords/bits like that, that all need shifting hands from now, and preferably it should all be done by the end of term 3 so new exec can perform their duties.\r\n    a. A generic version needs adding to the beginning of the handover doc once we\u2019ve gone through all that\r\n2. Might be good to add a summary flowchart at the beginning of the handover doc too that gives timescales for various bits to be completed.\r\n3. Nigel: Might be a good time to talk about adding new exec photos to website and special exceptions therefrom \r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n1. New exec and old exec: work through the checklist, try and get everything on it done by the end of this term.\r\n2. I\u2019ll try and do this at some point once the handover is mostly complete.\r\n3. New exec photos: responsibility of the new web admin to make sure these are done (asap!)\r\n\r\n**5.2. Duty Adjustment Suggestions**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\nThere are issues with the distribution of exec duties. Secretary does too much, for example. The exec have put suggestions on what duties to switch, and also what needs to be added, which I will now summarise for your discussion:\r\n\r\n1. Hoodies: should be moved from Sec > Treas\r\n    a. All big money transaction duties like this should be under the Treasurer.\r\n2. Dice: duty needs to be added to Treas\r\n3. Quiz: running it every time shouldn\u2019t be the sole responsibility of the Sec. Instead, the Sec should find an volunteer runner each time (it can be themself if they want!). This way, they can also participate in the quiz sometimes.\r\n4. Elections section needs to be added!\r\n5. Nigel: I\u2019m of the opinion that the exec meeting polls/ set-up ought to be streamlined, which will save the General Secretary some effort. I proposed setting a regular meeting time for every term, but apparently people\u2019s schedules change too often for that so idk\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n* Whatever the new exec deems appropriate to do should then be updated in the handover document by the relevant parties.\r\n* Discuss responsibility of quiz prizes next week?\r\n* Ares and Finnb will work on the elections section in the coming few weeks\r\n* Exec meeting set up is a future discussion\r\n\r\n**5.3. Other Odds & Ends**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n1. Switching the Exec Chat to Discord - I\u2019ve already set up the server and most of you have joined.\r\n    a. Should this change be made official after this meeting or later?\r\n2. Switching our timetabling over to a Google Calendar?\r\n    a. Old Sec/New Sec will need to work this out\r\n    b. Web Admin will need to work out how to effectively integrate such a system into the website (by next year?)\r\n3. Draft/CCGs FB group\r\n    a. Need to formally integrate them together (rename the group)\r\n    b. Put draft schedule on this group?\r\n4. Hoodie order (Term 3??)\r\n    a. Need to do an exec (and member) hoodie order during Term 3 (so exec have hoodies by next year, and so any members who missed out can bump up the order numbers) \r\n    b. Need to also have a discussion about when to do hoodie orders from here on out (next meeting?)\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n1. I will repost the invite link in the FB chat, we will do the switchover following this meeting\r\n2. It will be done\r\n3. Stick the draft schedule on the website and the FB group\r\n    a. Newsletters good too\r\n    b. Draft/CCGs Rep(s): Need to rename the fb group\r\n4. By the start of term 3\r\n    a. Set it up end of term 2\r\n    b. General consensus that they should be done once a year, at the end of term 2/start of term 3, so that the new exec and general orders can be lumped together\r\n\r\n**6.1. Gigante Computers**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n* Got an email from Gigante computers with a Wargames promo they're doing, with a special promo for our members (extra 5% product, in store and preordered)\r\n* They\u2019re thinking we could come up with a way to verify society members to them\r\n    * GDPR means we can\u2019t give them a list of society members (also has an issue with up-to-dateness)\r\n    * Hoodies: probably not. Not limited to current members, not all members have them.\r\n    * Dice????\r\n    * Or mock up society ID cards?\r\n    * **They could give us a discount code**\r\n* Or members could buy through the society, and they sell to us\r\n\r\n* Games workshop contacted them if they'd like to distribute since Young's hobbies shut down\r\n* Scot from Young's hobbies told them about the society and the upcoming apocalypse event\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n* We\u2019ll talk to them about use of a discount code\r\n* Need to specify a well defined date of finishing\r\n* Advertise it everywhere!\r\n* Jon is now responsible for this!\r\n\r\n**6.2. Escape Games**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n* James has told escape games that he\u2019s retiring. Need someone to take over this responsibility? Could be anybody. Our current arrangement is not well defined.\r\n    * They\u2019re a community-organised thing, different staff members will give you different discounts. Need to get this clarified. \r\n    * Definitely do at least flat 10% off GW stuff. More stuff is subject to negotiation. Large order (\u00a3150-200) can be up to 20%.\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n* Get in contact with James Coot.\r\n* Need to pick an exec member to be responsible for this\r\n    * James SF will make the introductions formally with our new point of contact exec.\r\n* Don\u2019t buy magic product from them.\r\n* **Note: Ben as new treasurer would like all old exec to tell him what deals we have with outside organisations.**\r\n\r\n**7. Camera Reprisal (if time)**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n* No time to discuss this, and it was not researched further since last meeting.\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n* Discuss this next meeting.\r\n\r\n**8. Summary To-Do List**\r\n*To Do:*\r\n\r\n1. Sort out games den deal.\r\n2. Someone go hand in the exec sheet!\r\n3. Send your quiz rounds to me\r\n4. Constitution rework\r\n5. Handover doc changes\r\n    a. Add Elections\r\n\t\tb. Create summary flowchart\r\n\t\tc. Add checklist to start\r\n\t\td. Duty changes\r\n\t\te. James SF: add bit abt Escape games\r\n6. Gigante computers?\r\n7. Exec photos\r\n8. Work through checklist!\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n1. Send a rep to games den and ask what\u2019s happening with the WER, what is happening with the promos we were promised, what we can expect going forward and then decide whether we want to actually go forward with them next year.\r\n2. Callum\r\n3. Thanks\r\n4. Callum and Finnbar\r\n5. -\r\n6. Jon will sort this\r\n7. Web admin\r\n8. Everyone\r\n\r\n**Next Meeting**\r\n*Info/To Discuss (Focussing)*\r\n\r\n1. Week 10 - Finnbar can trial run this one??\r\n2. Hoodie order discussion (Ben as Treasurer - but maybe already discussed everything)\r\n3. Camera (LARP reps - Jakub and Tim)\r\n4. Mega game (Finnbar and Callum)\r\n5. Budget reprisal (Nathan)\r\n6. How to SU good (Callum)\r\n7. How to use the banner (Patrick)\r\n8. Feedback on LGS negotiation (Alisdair)\r\n9. Feedback on Gigante games (Jon)\r\n10. Quiz prize responsibility discussion (Finnbar leads this discussion + Ben as Treasurer)\r\n11. Quick reminder on commercial relations (Ben but it\u2019s only a quick reminder so no need for focussing, just shove it in the reminders/updates)\r\n12. Discussion on how to arrange future exec meetings (Finnbar)\r\n13. Escape games update?? (James SF)\r\n\r\nSo long, Tabletop, and thanks for all the work! This will probably be the last meeting I minute, as Finnbar (your new super duper sec) will likely take the reins from here. \r\n- Ares",

Compsoc v Tabletop lazerquest event: Term 2 Week 10, Tuesday 5th March. Any objections?\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n1. David Brown has offered to be our contact within Physics who is our \u201cvouch\u201d/middleman if necessary\r\n    a. Robb Johnston hasn\u2019t answered Nigel\u2019s calls yet\r\n    b.

Nathan will get Patrick a budget\r\n7. No objection\r\n\r\n**1. AGM**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n* Email going out after this meeting about amendment suggestion deadline, and I\u2019ve created a forum thread for that.\r\n* Thank you to everyone who helped with motions.\r\n* There are now too many motions to list here, but there\u2019s a PDF in the drive (linked in the email you\u2019ll get and on the thread) listing them all. Are there any anyone wants to discuss?\r\n* **Nominations so far:**\r\n    * Pres: Callum\r\n    * Treasurer: Benjamin\r\n    * Secretary: no one officially\r\n    * Board games: Josh Smith\r\n    * Wargs: no one officially yet\r\n    * Draft: no one officially, but someone is likely going to do it (Daniel)\r\n    * CCGs: no one officially, Alisdair?\r\n    * RPGs: Anakin, Jon\r\n    * Web Admin: Thomas\r\n    * Comms: no one officially, Finnb\r\n    * LARP: no one officially\r\n    * Quartermaster: Timothy re-running\r\n* Nigel: what\u2019s the state of the powerpoint?\r\n* Who\u2019s going to be good for HSO, EOO, Welfare? \r\n    * HSO: Quartermaster should do this\r\n    * Discussion for after AGM\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n* Patrick will go to Welfare Officer in SU to discuss the anonymous complaints system and potentially get an official statement about this. It\u2019s something that the SU should provide over societies individually, probably? Might need to lobby the SU about this. Regardless, we need to know the SU's stance on this.\r\n* Running of AGM rules:\r\n    * Only second a motion if you really think it needs to be voted on\r\n    * Motions can be dismissed (by majority vote?)\r\n    * Hard timer on discussion due to limited time, and Nigel needs to police discussion to make sure it doesn\u2019t get circular.\r\n   * Whether we vote by hands raised or on paper should be done on a motion-by-motion basis. If at least one member requests secret, it has to be secret. All exec votes by paper by default.\r\n* Make sure you have max 30 seconds prepared on what you\u2019ve done as an exec during the last year for the society update at the start.\r\n\r\n**2. Pantomime Society borrowing LARP gear**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n* Pantomime Society (Henry Smith) want to borrow some LARP gear for a lotr thing they\u2019re having next week. Isn\u2019t a Sunday so no clash with our LARP.\r\n* He\u2019s already a member so that\u2019s sorted (he DMs RPGs).\r\n* Jakub wants permission to go ahead\r\n* Are we going to ask for any compensation?\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n* Need to give them a health and safety rundown (specifically no stabbing) and how to use the weapons etc\r\n* And a rundown of \u201cif you break it, you replace it\u201d\r\n* Can use the boardgames log for the borrowing\r\n* Compensation: shout-out promotion, and they\u2019ve already bought membership\r\n\r\n**3. Camera Options**\r\n*Info/To Discuss:*\r\n\r\n* Option 1: \u00a340 camera - not waterproof, but splashproof, has image stabilisation (good for LARP). \r\n    * ~14 Mpx, better than your average smartphone\r\n* Option 2: \u00a369 camera, ~16 Mpx\r\n* Preferably want one that\u2019s shock proof\r\n* Also need to get a nice bag for it. \r\n* Basic requirements: >12 Mpx, shock proof, or not worth buying over using a smartphone camera\r\n\r\n*Actions:*\r\n\r\n* Use smartphone until we can find a shockproof camera\r\n* Jakub and Tim can do further research\r\n\r\n**Next Meeting!**\r\n*To Discuss (Focussing):*\r\nWill be week after AGM (Week 9) and will be new exec + old exec (probably 2 hours)\r\n\r\n1. Tabletop Weekend (Patrick + new BGs rep?)\r\n2. Quiz (Ares + new Sec?)\r\n3. Compsoc update if necessary\r\n4. Lazer Quest (Nigel)\r\n5. Camera Reprisal (Jakub and/or Tim + new LARP reps?)",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nBet you didn't think you were going to be hearing from me this early! Well, ~~I got bored~~ Ash and I have been hard at work bringing some class to the newsletters. Let's look at some of the features, with help from these people I found on the street!\r\n\r\n## Headings and Subheadings\r\n**Finn**: Woah, that text is big!\r\n**Bar**: Sure thing, Finn - that's a heading! We can have headings, subheadings, **bold text**, *italic text*, ~~strikethrough~~ and more due to the wonderful powers of Markdown!\r\n**Finn**: Oooh. Also we have images within the document now. Here's one I made earlier.\r\n\r\n![A CUTE CAT](https://purr.objects-us-east-1.dream.io/i/u7J75.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Bar**: SUCH A GOOD CAT.\r\n**Finn**: I KNOW RIGHT.\r\n**Bar**: \\*ahem\\*\r\n**Finn**: Indeed.\r\n\r\n## Other Features\r\n**Bar**: There are a few neat features that you might not have (or not been able to) notice!\r\n**Finn**: For example, there's a button for the publisher of the newsletter to get an email version that they can copy and paste into the SU's email system, thus making it look pretty in email as well as on the site.\r\n**Bar**: And there's a summary thing that our great newsletter authors can provide to show what's in the newsletter in the list view! Got a friend with a five second attention span? Get them to read the summary!\r\n**Finn**: Wow.\r\n**Bar**: Also behind the scenes is a new editor for the newsletters, as well as the ability to save drafts.\r\n**Finn**: This editor is live across the rest of the site as well! So you can type with headings and underlines and all that in the forum and in event descriptions with the [SimpleMDE Editor](https://simplemde.com/).\r\n**Bar**: Ash and Finnbar seem to be okay at this coding thing.\r\n**Finn**: Nah, must have been a fluke.\r\n\r\nThanks, Finn and Bar! I hope that everyone continues to enjoy using the site. (Ash is apparently indifferent...)\r\nYes, even you, CharmdateBabs.\r\n\r\nWe've got more fixes in store, so you'll likely be hearing from us soon! Whether you like it or not.\r\n\r\nFinnbar Keating\r\n*Comms Officer and Second-In-Coding-Command-Apparently*",

      "title": "Welcome Week Newsletter",
      "body": "Hi everybody! I hope you had a great summer, and if you're joining us for the first time this year, welcome! Leave your shoes by the door.\r\nI'm Finnbar the Communications Officer, which means I send you a newsletter every week! I'm so sorry. More seriously, this is the place for announcements about events and other happenings, as well as whatever jokes (some more dramatic than others) I can slip into here. I hope you enjoy reading this!\r\n\r\n## What did we do this summer?\r\nDespite the fact that most people were at home during the summer, things still happened! People continued to meet up for board games, wargames and card games. We also got some new board games - Sushi Go Party (draft the best meal!) and Through The Ages (be the best at the *concept of time*), as pictured below. Finally, another postgrad board games event was run at the Dirty Duck to much success, with many board games played.\r\n\r\n![Through The Ages and Sushi Go](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/tta%20and%20sushi%20go.jpg) ![Duck Postgrad Summer 2018](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/pub.jpg)\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to the tireless work of the LARP Reps, [Unity 6 was released](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/UNITY_6.0.1.pdf) with much excitement! And then Unity 6.0.1 was released due to much questioning and loophole finding. Unity is the system that our local LARPs are run in - to find out more, why not go to one of our LARP events?\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nIt's welcome week! Which means we'll be welcoming you back with our usual events, as well as an Introductory RPGs special event. Us exec will be on hand teaching some of our favourite games, so please join us even if you're a total beginner. That's not to say that we won't teach people in any other weeks though, we're just making a special effort to do so this week.\r\n\r\n### Wargames (Monday 5pm, B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\nOur usual wargames session! For welcome week we have many existing, experienced members around to teach you their favourite wargame, so this is the place to go for a friendly (or at least as friendly as war can be) game of Warhammer, X-wing, Warmachine and more! So whether you\u2019d like to send Orks and Eldar into battle, or be Luke Skywalker and fly around controlling the tides of war, we\u2019d love to see you there.\r\n\r\n### Magic: The Gathering Draft (Tuesday 6pm, B2.01 Maths and Stats Building)\r\nFor those of you unfamiliar with a Magic draft, you get boosters of cards, select your favourites (or at least, the least bad cards) as you pass them around the table, and use those cards to build a deck. This is an excellent way to build your collection! In this week\u2019s draft we\u2019ll be drafting the M19 set (you\u2019ll likely know better than me what that means). It\u2019s \u00a38, reduced by \u00a32 per pack you bring yourself. Furthermore, the prizes for the draft are Dominaria boosters, which our Magic Draft Rep says may contain \u201cinsane value\u201d; I don\u2019t rate them though because they have too few dinosaurs (Ixalan or nothing). That\u2019s random boosters for you, I guess. If you're completely new to Magic, we recommend you go to our Casual Card Games session (see below) before diving into a draft!\r\n\r\n### Boardgames (Wednesday 2pm, B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\nThis is our massive weekly board gaming session which runs from 2pm until 10pm (a whole eight hours of boardgaming fun) - so drop in whenever you\u2019d like and for as long as you'd like! Whether you\u2019re looking for an eight-hour long epic or maybe something with a slightly more sensible length, there\u2019ll be a game for you, with many smaller games available so please don\u2019t feel intimidated. There are always exec members around happy to teach new games, so don\u2019t feel like you have to be some board games expert to join us.\r\n\r\n### Casual Card Games (Thursday 4pm, B2.02 Maths and Stats Building)\r\nMore card games, because apparently one event a week isn\u2019t enough for the Magic players! More seriously, this is the place to go for Commander, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pok\u00e9mon or Netrunner (please Netrunner players, we need more of you). Whether you\u2019re an inexperienced planeswalker who wants to learn the ways of Magic or the best hacker who knows everything about Netrunner, there\u2019s fun to be had in this casual, beginner friendly session! Don't worry if you don't have decks though, as there will certainly be some intro decks for Magic and Netrunner.\r\n\r\n### Introductory Roleplaying Games (Saturday 12pm, Social Sciences Caf\u00e9)\r\nThis weekend is special, it turns out, with a massive collection of one-shots (single session roleplaying games) being run! Many systems will be being played, including Dungeons and Dragons 5e, Age of Rebellion (Star Wars!) and Call of Cthulhu. It's the perfect time to try out roleplaying in a friendly setting with many new people, and then later in term you can join a full campaign! The website is host to a variety of signups for campaigns - just look on our [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/)! Afterwards, there\u2019s a **pub social at The Phantom Coach at 7pm** for everyone involved in the society (not just those playing RPGs) so you can eat and socialise with the new friends you\u2019ve made and meet all the exec. Wow, food.\r\n\r\n### Live Action Roleplaying (Sunday 12pm, OC0.01 Oculus Building)\r\nIn LARP, you get to wear armour and actually fight (albeit with safer foam weaponry) while playing a character or monster! If that sounds like your thing, people will be getting set up in OC0.01, so head there to get changed and then existing members will guide you on your adventure (like Gandalf I guess, except there's many of them rather than just one so... I'm getting distracted). It\u2019ll be the first outing of Unity 6.0.1 (which has simplified previous editions), so don\u2019t feel like you have to be some kind of Unity expert to join us - our helpful and knowledgeable LARP reps will be there to run a great adventure and help out with any rules difficulties.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you for reading this far and I hope to see you at some of our events!\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)",

      "body": "[High noon, the Wild West. Two figures, mere shadows in the sunlight, standoff.]\r\n**Nigel**: Howdy.\r\n**Finnbar**: Howdy.\r\n**Nigel**: Fancy seeing you here.\r\n**Finnbar**: What did you expect, some random people off the street?\r\n[Both figures grab their guns, squinting in the sunlight.]\r\n**Nigel**: This town ain't big enough for those long form newsletters you keep writing.\r\n**Finnbar**: okay fair enough\r\n\r\n## Our Discord and Facebook groups\r\nThere have been questions about where to find our Discord server - its code is `xdDZnYQ`, so you can enter that after clicking \"join a server\" in the Discord app or on the website. There's a channel for every part of the society, so feel free to discuss anything related to us like how your last one-shot went or neat games being funded on Kickstarter. \r\nIf you're looking to plan games however, this is best done on the relevant Facebook groups (linked at the bottom of this newsletter). This is especially pertinent for Wargames (where there is a weekly post about what games people would like to play) and now also Casual Card Games, which is moving to a similar system.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nThere aren't any special events this week (perhaps for the best given how much we did last week!) but we still have our usual weekly events, listed below:\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00-22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00-22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00-22:00 B2.04/B2.05 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00-22:00 R0.03/R0.04 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00-17:00 starting in OC0.05 Oculus Building\r\n\r\nFor RPG locations, contact your GM! If after the Introductory Roleplaying Games session at the weekend you're itching to join a campaign or play more one-shots, have a look at our [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) right here on our website. At time of publishing there are two campaigns with open spaces, so take a look!\r\n\r\n## What did we do this week?\r\nWelcome Week just happened! And it was a huge success - we had lots of new people join us for wargames, boardgames (with so many people there that we had to commandeer another room), card games and LARP. Many ships were ~~crashed~~ flown around, many resources traded, many lands tapped and many bandits and cultists fought. It was great to see these events be so popular!\r\n\r\nOur Introductory RPGs session was a massive hit with over 100 people joining us for one-shot sessions across a variety of systems! We had D&D 5th Edition, Call of Cthulu and many more (including an entirely homebrew system) played, with adventures being cooked up across campus for a variety of different groups and skill levels. I wasn't in every single session so can't comment on them all, but as a GM I found a new... appreciation for how the Mold Earth spell can mess up all of your plans by digging a trench right where the bad guys were about to ambush the party (I'm not even mad). Also one group managed to \"slightly bisect vertically\" the person they were meant to be buying fuel off of and to be honest I have questions but not the words to articulate them.\r\n\r\nThe hugest of thanks go out to our exec for making these events such a success, as well as all of the existing members that taught or ran the games they love! It was really great meeting you all - I hope everyone had a lot of fun this week and that we'll keep seeing you at our events. :)\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n![Societies Fair](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/socsfair-welcome.JPG)\r\nLook at all of our lovely exec hoodies!\r\n\r\n![Welcome Week Boardgames](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/42754208_299313080899401_9023614203134476288_n.jpg)\r\nOne of the two rooms from our boardgaming session.\r\n\r\n![Welcome Week LARP](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/larp-welcome.jpg)\r\nMany bandits and cultists were fought in LARP, and only one of the parties died horribly!",

      "body": "Wow, it's already week two!\r\n[Squints at an important-looking list.]\r\n[Squints again at list, this time holding it upside-down.]\r\n**Oh no it's already week two**\r\n\r\n## Special Events\r\n### Tabletop Weekend (November 3rd and 4th, B2.02)\r\nIf you've been here for a while, you've got a good idea what this entails. If you're new, then I have a treat for you! An entire weekend of all the games you can think of - stay for a few hours or even be mad and stay for the entire time (I am not responsible for how tired you'll get though). I'm sure different parts of the society will be running special events during the weekend (there have been cube drafts before as well as the all-important Rhino Hero World Championships), so keep an eye out for announcements and maybe get work done before that weekend so you don't miss out (said Finnbar, hypocritically). We'd love to see you there, as always!\r\n\r\n### Rebirth Netrunner Tournament (October 21st, 1-5pm, E0.23 Social Sciences)\r\nDespite Netrunner's discontinuation, we're continuing to run events for it. So, if you've played a few games and have gone \"hey, I'd like to play more\", here's a casual tournament! And if you've not played but would be interested, turn up to our usual Casual Card Games event (or even ask us at boardgames!) and there should be a Netrunner player or two to teach you. Signups are on Facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/172097093678397/).\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nNo special events this week, but here are our usual ones:\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00-22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00-22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00-22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00-22:00, R3.41 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00-17:00 starting in in OC0.05 Oculus Building\r\n\r\nAs has been said before, contact your GM for RPG times and locations. If you're looking for one-shots or campaigns to join, take a look at the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) right here on our website.\r\n\r\n## What happened this week?\r\nI'm not well-versed in the ways of Magic, but the **Guilds of Ravnica** set (or as I've been told to call it The Return to Return to Ravnica) has been released recently, and is Very Good. It's also the draft set this week (and last week) so maybe you should return to return to draft if you want to play it, as \u00a38 is still a very cheap draft. Also more pressingly why do the two-colour faction guild things have odd names, I mean seriously the word \"Boros\" doesn't particularly convey red and white, why didn't they just join the colours together and call it \"rite\" or \"whed\" or something it's really not that difficult.\r\n\r\nIn the RPGs corner, Lawful Tim is running a D&D 5e oneshot every week for the rest of term. In last week's adventure they spent five hours turning on a lighthouse. If you're looking for that kind of riveting excitement, keep an eye on the events page for his signups, usually posted on Mondays! \r\n...wait, you don't know who Lawful Tim is? He's part of a legend dating back to the very start of the society. The society's balance is held in the Timforce, a sacred set of triangles that when reunited let the user play any game they want - a source of power that could shake the very fabric of our being. The Timforce of Wisdom is held by Tim Hutchinson, the aforementioned Lawful Tim - a quiet figure known for his ability to run one-shots and snack. The Timforce of Power is held by Timothy Smith, also known as Chaotic Tim - the kind of Tim to kill all his players in a one-shot and lose exactly one shoe. The Timforce of Courage, however, is held by an unknown entity, one we only know as \"Neutral Tim\". All we know is that this Tim is the only thing keeping this society from falling into disarray, and will reappear when the society needs him most. That is... **the Legend of Tim**.\r\n\r\nTo end slightly underwhelmingly after talking about a legend that continues to shake our society to its core, we were at another societies fair this weekend, this time for prospective students! We're hoping that we've persuaded many of them to join our ranks next year with the temptations of gaming.\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n[This week's newsletter is dedicated to the various peeps on #rpgs on Discord for the naming of the Tims, and Aleksa for \"return to return to draft\"]\r\n\r\n![Prospective Open Day](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/openday.jpg)",

Meanwhile, Mexico has special events sometimes!\r\n**Finn**: But the tabletop weekend is happening during the weekend of week five! Which is actually kind of soon now. There'll be all kinds of games from all the different parts of the society, so if you've not had a chance to try something out, the weekend will be a good time to do so - just drop in for as long or as little as you like. We'll update you with events being run during the weekend closer to the time!\r\n[\"Weekend\" is tapped, and a red agent placed on it.]\r\n\r\n### Netrunner Rebirth Tournament (Sunday 1-5pm, E0.23 Social Sciences)\r\n**Finn**: I'm thinking Netrunner.\r\n**Bar**: I'm thinking that it's discontinued, why would you even consider running such an event. Just choose Mexico already.\r\n**Finn**: Just shush already. There's a Netrunner tournament designed for beginners running this weekend (with a limited cardpool), because it turns out it's still a fun game. It's best if you look at the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/172097093678397/) - there are lots of resources for newer players there and you can message the Facebook page if you have any questions, or find one of the Netrunner players at Board Games or Casual Card Games.\r\n[\"Netrunner\" is tapped, and a red agent is placed on it.]\r\n\r\nSure, now it's the blue team's turn. Your clue is *Weekly, 6*.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\n**Bar**: Well, considering this is a newsletter about the tabletop society, it's probably about their weekly events.\r\n**Finn**: This is a newsletter? I thought this was the real life.\r\n**Bar**: Maybe it's just fantasy.\r\n**Finn**: ...caught in a landslide?\r\n**Bar**: what are you doing. Anyway, there was a handy timetable, lemme find it:\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00-22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00-22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00-22:00, B2.04/5 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00-22:00, R3.41 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00-17:00 starting in in **OC0.01** Oculus Building (NOTE: This is a slightly different room than advertised!)\r\n\r\n[\"Wargames\", \"Magic\", \"Boardgames\", \"Card Games\" and \"LARP\" are tapped, all getting blue agents.]\r\n**Finn**: This is ridiculous\r\n**Bar**: No, it's skill. Anyway, I'm thinking the sixth one is RPGs, as even though there isn't a regular weekly drop-in event, Saturdays are when the majority of the RPGs are held. If you're interested in taking part in a one-shot or campaign, take a look at the [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/). This is frequently updated, especially with Lawful Tim putting up a new one-shot every Monday.\r\n[\"RPGs\" is tapped, and predictably gets a blue agent.]\r\n**Finn**: You better have a good clue for me.\r\n\r\nOkay, red team: you get *Prehistoric, 3*\r\n**Finn**: WHAT IS THAT EVEN MEANT TO MEAN\r\n**Bar**: Prehistoric: \"Of, relating to, or belonging to the era be-\"\r\n**Finn**: Yes I know what it means, I was kind of hoping for a clue about the society, not about prehistory\r\n\r\n## What happened this week?\r\n**Finn**: Umm, well Casual Card Games was pretty great, because there were actually a wide variety of games being played! At one point there was a table of Magic, a table of Yu-Gi-Oh and three tables of Netrunner.\r\n**Bar**: Given the whole dead game thing, that's quite impressive. Also, it turns out the infinite power of LARP is only stopped by one force - rain. The usual LARP session was replaced by an indoor in-character social, which was probably for the best given the awful weather.\r\n**Finn**: Also it seems like the whole Timforce thing has awakened a creative force within Jakub, who modified a GIF he found (below). The newsletter has fan art now, have we peaked? Is it all downhill from here?\r\n\r\n![The Timforce](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/timforce.gif)\r\n\r\n**Bar**: It went downhill from when you opened your mouth, Finn. Also, are you stalling?\r\n**Finn**: No I'm just telling everyone how great the week was. Also why is \"jack of all bones, master of flesh\" a card. How do these even relate to prehistoric?\r\n**Bar**: Are leprechauns prehistoric?\r\n**Finn**: What\r\n**Bar**: Choose Mexico already\r\n**Finn**: FINE I'll choose Mexico\r\n[\"Mexico\" is tapped. To nobody's surprise, it was the assassin and the red team loses.]\r\n**Finn**: I'm out\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n![A popular CCGs session.](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/44023367_1164200297068080_4902548324768284672_n.jpg)\r\nA very popular CCGs session!",

It turns out Halloween falls on the Wednesday of week five, so we're having some **Boo-ard Games** (thanks Ross) on that day! Get in costume (if you like), bring pumpkins and other decorations and get ready for a mild spookening. With games such as Dead of Winter and Arkham Horror in our collection there should be sufficient cause for fun Halloween times - this is definitely a treat (not a trick) that you shouldn't miss. Also there will likely be a chaos draft on the Tuesday and various spooky one-shots, so stay tuned and read next week's newsletter where we will reveal all! (It will be themed with six-word horror stories, so if you have any of those, send them in.)\r\n\r\n### Tabletop Weekend (10am November 3rd - 10pm November 4th, B2.02)\r\nAnd if Hallowe'ek wasn't enough excitement for you, the tabletop weekend is still happening! Drop in for as long or as little as you like for two days of great gaming. There will be many events being run during the weekend by the different parts of the society - previously we've had Magic and Netrunner cube drafts run, and I would very much like to run the Bullet Rhino Hero World Championships 2018. Keep an eye out for details! Also there's always late night Two Rooms and a Boom and takeaway orders.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nNo special events this week, so here's the usual timetable.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R3.41 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in OC0.05 Oculus Building\r\n\r\nAs always, if you're interested in taking part in an RPG one-shot or campaign (which usually happen on Saturdays) have a look on the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/), and if you're looking to run one please put it up there and we'll get you a room to run it in (talk to Callum Marvell, our expert RPG Rep).\r\n\r\n## What happened this week?\r\nAn unexpected highlight of this week was the playing of the Microscope world-building RPG in our weekly board games session. The group created a world where humans and fire lizards violently coexisted in a cave network. This involved some questionable decisions, including the base \"ingredients\" of the game - oxygen outside the cave was banned while cannibalism was OK (the question \"why don't the cannibals eat the government people\" was asked). Also some clones turned up at some point maybe? I don't really know, ask Lawful Tim, Victoria or Alex for more details.\r\n\r\nIn this week's Timshot (short for Lawful Tim One-Shot) the party tried to catch a fleeing scribe. In doing so they bought a mule they called Eggnog (prompty nicknamed Noggy). They went on a wonderful adventure with Noggy, including throwing eggs at an ancient stone circle (wait is this vandalism), stealing from a dead gold dragon wyrmling (IS THIS VANDALISM) and most importantly made some adorable armour for Noggy out of the gold dragon scales, which totally forgives all of the possible vandalism. Noggy and Friends is coming to children's TV at the end of this quarter.\r\n\r\nFinally, there was a Netrunner tournament! Sam Coy, who came last in the previous tournament ended up winning (playing the long game huh), earning himself a really nice painting of the Netrunner card Rebirth (by my housemate Franziska) and most importantly earning himself the chance to be immortalised in the newsletter. Fun was had by all, and due to our tournament organising efforts we now have many demo decks to show people the wonderful ways of Netrunner. The biggest of thanks go to Ash and Tim for helping me organise this event, including printing and cutting out a ridiculous number of proxy cards.\r\n\r\nAs always, much love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n![Microscope post-it notes](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/44458596_1122688844562735_5926652090741948416_n.jpg)\r\nI feel like there's a very long story behind these post-it notes from Microscope.\r\n\r\n![Sam Coy, winner of the Rebirth Netrunner Tournament](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/44433693_485398818634172_8454062013100851200_n.jpg)\r\nSam Coy, the winner of the Rebirth Netrunner Tournament shaking hands with me (the tournament organiser).",

You knock, and after no answer, push the door, it creaking for what feels like an eternity. You step inside and find an abandoned room with nothing in it but cobwebs and a laptop labelled \"Tabletop Society Newsletter Sending Machine\". It's obvious that the room has not been touched for months. Lights flicker. A cold wind passes through an open window, causing shivers from the back of your neck all the way down to your feet. You hear the patter of rain outside accompanied by the whirring of the laptop. How could this be the right place?\r\n\r\nLightning.\r\nA long, breathless pause.\r\nLightning.\r\n\r\nA figure creeps in through the window, wearing a crooked witch's hat and a soaked purple exec hoodie. They drop a fake zombie arm in the corner of the room, muttering about writing the newsletter, and sit on the floor. They take off their hat and hood.]\r\n\r\nHi! Glad you could make it. Don't mind the cobwebs, I've not been in here for ages. It's Hallowe'ek, so I've spruced up the place a bit with this zombie arm I got from Tesco's. It's very **handy** to have around, and it didn't cost me an **arm** and a leg. Anyway, let's get on with it before I make enough puns to lose the entire readership of the newsletter.\r\n\r\n## Special Events\r\n### Tabletop Weekend (10am November 3rd - 10pm November 4th, B2.02)\r\nWhat's the best way to end Hallowe'ek? With more games, of course! Join us for as long as you'd like to play games from any part of the society. You could play a huge game that you've not had time to during other sessions, or try out a part of the society you've been unable to attend in the past! As always, there'll be exec around during the whole event to teach games and generally be helpful, so come on down even if this is your first event with us. There's now an actual [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/169315520672647/) too if that's your thing. Finally, parts of the society have been known to run extra special events during tabletop weekends (like Magic cube drafts and the inimitable Bullet Rhino Hero) so keep an eye out on the various Facebook groups (see the bottom of the newsletter for links) and on the website.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nAll your favourite events are happening except with a spooky twist! What a treat (not trick). Since we're all in a Hallowe'en mood, I've provided a six-word horror story for some of the events we're running!\r\n\r\n**Extremely Normal Wargames (Monday 17:00-22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse)**\r\nWargames is normal this week. Boo. Hiss.\r\n\r\n**Magic: The Gathering Chaos Draft (Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse)**\r\n*\"Mythic rares bent after riffle shuffle...\"*\r\nFor the Magic Draft this week, we're holding a chaos draft! This means that instead of all of the packs being from one or two sets, they're from whatever sets we can cobble together. It's like we're resurrecting old Magic packs, woo, spooky! As well as the usual Guilds of Ravnica prize packs we also have some Innistrad packs, which I'm informed is a very good set and is more importantly keeping with the theme of Hallowe'ek so I approve. Finally, draft is still \u00a38 this week despite the improved prizes and general chaos. There's a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1990223834397311/) if you're feeling social too.\r\n\r\n**Boo-ard Games (Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse)**\r\n*\"We've lost every game but Monopoly.\"*\r\nIt's actually Hallowe'en on Wednesday, so we're pulling out all the stops. We'll have spooky decorations and the scariest games we own - so come join us for Dead of Winter, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Betrayal on the House on the Hill, Arkham Horror and more! And if you're not feeling spooky for some reason we'll still have all our other usual games. Bonus points if you come in costume! [Faaaaaccceebboooookkkk.](https://www.facebook.com/events/2292232451009956/)\r\n\r\n**Creepy Card Games (Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R3.41 Ramphal Building)**\r\n*\"New banlist! Oh, my deck's worthless...\"*\r\nOur secretary (full title: Supreme Self-Professed Overlord of Halloween, Demon Summoner Extraordinaire, Expert of Spooky and Ruler of the Undead) Ares is going to be trying out a modified Commander format called [Mysteries of Innistrad](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/9q4fuv/in_the_spirit_of_halloween_i_made_an_edh_variant/). They'll need opponents for it though, so come and try it out! Also the Netrunner players will continue to try and perform necromancy on their favourite card game (which seems to be going quite well actually). Maybe the Yu-Gi-Oh players will find something spooky to do too, like all play decks with \"Pumpking the King of Ghosts\" in them.\r\n\r\n**Spooky One-Shots (Various)**\r\n*\"Roll death save ...a natural one.\"*\r\nFor Hallowe'ek we're running some spooky one-shots. These will be put up on the [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) during the week so keep an eye on that, but we'll try our best to announce any that come up. There'll be a scarier-than-average Timshot, although last week's party seemed to have a pre-Hallowe'ek spook by waiting for the big dragon boss to show up rather than scarpering in the *four days* that they had to escape.\r\nAlso, Ares (Supreme Self-Professed etc etc) is running a spooky D&D one-shot called **The House of the Midnight Violet**, involving recovering a rare flower from a mysterious island submerged in fog - signups are [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/64/)! Otherwise if you're part of a campaign already, check with your DM for time/place of that this week, although it might not be running because of Tabletop Weekend.\r\n\r\n**Whispers In The Dark LARP (Sunday 12:00 to 17:00, starting in OC0.05 Oculus Building)**\r\n*\"One hundred percent chance of rain.\"*\r\nSomething ominous brews in the world of Unity... wild beasts, soulless horrors and other monstrosities gather with an unknown purpose. What mysteries await? Come along **if you dare** to a LARP session that critics (okay, just our LARP Rep Jakub) are calling our most dangerous and nail-biting adventure yet!\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nIt was a mostly uneventful week four. Callum (our RPG rep) brought in Dinosaur Island, a game about running your own Jurassic Park and it has loads of pink dinosaur minis so is possibly the best game ever. We can go home now, there will be no better game - nothing will ever beat lots of dinosaur minis. Except if you also put submarines in the game somehow. Hmm...\r\n\r\nAlso, you may have received an email from the SU about focus groups happening on the 13th, 14th and 15th November. Some of our exec went to one recently and found it was a useful forum for communicating our problems to the SU. So if you have any issues you'd like to bring up, this might actually be a forum where they'll be solved.\r\n\r\nUmm... I should probably end the newsletter in a spooky way.\r\n\r\nYours spookily,\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n![Poster for the Chaos Draft](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/chaos-draft-shrunk.png)\r\n\r\n![Poster for Boo-ard Games](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/boo-ard-games-shrunk.png)",

The tinsel is out, music is playing, every tree is a Christmas tree... help me I've been trapped in the Seasonal aisle in Tescos for what feels like weeks and I've had to buy extremely expensive novelty chocolate to survive.\r\nLuckily I have my laptop, so I can at least spend my time trapped in Christmas purgatory writing this newsletter. Also, if you're the first to tell me all of the games present in the title of the newsletter I'll give you a drawing of a trophy with a smiley face on it (prepare to be disappointed).\r\n\r\n## Special Events\r\n### Warhammer 40k League\r\nIn Wargames, a 40k league is starting! Armies are only 1000pts, which is quite small so don't feel you have to have a massive collection to sign up. There's a prize too of a single infantry character for a faction of your choice so it's definitely worth looking into! Talk to our Wargames rep James Sampson-Foster if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n### Post-Hallowe'ek One Shots\r\nEveryone seems to be big on one-shots, so we've got a few more running this week! Signups are / will be put on the website within the next day or two. As always, if you're looking for campaigns or one-shots, our [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) is the place to go.\r\n\r\n* **Big Dracula** (Wednesday 5-10pm, H0.01): a one-shot run by me in Dread, a simple system where character creation is done by questionnaire and instead of rolling dice to resolve events, you pull from an unstable Jenga tower. You and your fellow contestants have entered the Hallowe'en themed reality TV show Big Dracula, where you vote your friends off this mortal coil... but not really, it's just a game show, right? Signups are [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/67/).\r\n* **Assault on Gumdrop Mountain** (Saturday from midday, meeting at Social Sciences Caf\u00e9): a D&D one-shot run by our RPG Rep Callum. You and your fellow adventurers are going on a lovely hike to a mountain so horrifying that you have to take a hallucinogenic elixir to act at even close to full capacity. The drug makes the mountain bearable, but also makes it look like a candy-infused landscape! Signups available soon\u2122.\r\n* **Escape from Phlan** (Saturday from midday, meeting at Social Sciences Caf\u00e9): Tim's usual weekly D&D one-shot! This week, a bunch of noble figures have been trapped in the city as it's now encompassed by a wall of marsh plants. Inconvenient. Also there's a dracolich, try not to disturb it. Signups are [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/68).\r\n\r\n### Tabletop Weekend 2:  Electric Boogaloo (Week 9 Weekend)\r\nThere's not much to say about this yet, but the second Tabletop weekend of this term will be happening during the weekend of week 9 - same time, same place - with our termly quiz happening on the Friday (November 30th, 6-8:30pm with a trip to Varsity afterwards) just before the weekend starts! So keep that weekend open for even more fun gaming times.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nAside from the extra one-shots, we've got a relatively normal week with a slightly funky room booking for boardgames.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, **B2.03** Science Concourse (with H3.02 Humanities Building booked for if we need extra space).\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R3.41 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in OC0.05 Oculus Building\r\n\r\n## What happened this week?\r\nA lot, it turns out! We had our Chaos draft on Tuesday, won by Ethan and Alex. I've been reliably informed that both a Karn and a Polluted Delta were opened, but none of the best Innistrad cards (Liliana and Snapcaster Mage) were found. Random boosters, huh?\r\nBoo-ard Games was a hit, with Arkham Horror (2nd Edition) escaping from the box we'd sealed it in and hidden in Westwood. Dead of Winter and Werewolf were also played, and people came in costume! Most importantly though the zombie arm was a huge hit.\r\nMysteries of Innistrad was a success at Creepy Card Games as players secretly became werewolves, vampires and inquisitors while still getting to play Magic. I expect having paws would sort of make that difficult but who knows, I'm not a Magic player or a werewolf, but hang on wouldn't your claws damage the cards and greatly reduce their value? That seems like a bad idea. Anyway, now that the role cards have been made for it you can play it during any CCGs session!\r\nTabletop weekend was a huge success with many people turning up for fun boardgaming times! I'll be honest that Siderial Confluence at 1am sounds like a questionable decision, but who am I to judge. It also felt like a revival of Boo-ard Games with Arkham Horror (3rd Edition) being played many times (thanks CapnAlex!) and I think there may have even been another game of Dead of Winter. Either way, I really hope everyone had a wonderful week! The biggest thanks go to the exec for being around to run their various events, with a special mention for Patrick and his ability to not need sleep.\r\n\r\nLemme go sleep now.\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n![Boo-ard Games](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/booard-games-photo.jpg)\r\nLook, some people even came in costume!

Whoops. To try and amend this, they set out on a quest to find the Timforce, a great and powerful item that lets its user play any game they want, hoping to use it as a trade to gain the newsletter back.

Do you like tables? Have a look at our wondrous array of tabletops... wait, that's not it, it's about tabletop games, 36 hours of them in fact. There'll also be our termly quiz on the Friday (November 30th, 6-8:30pm with a trip to Varsity afterwards) just before with some very special prizes - all will be revealed soon...\r\n\r\n### Netrunner Modded Tournament (18th November 1pm - 5pm, E0.23 Social Sciences)\r\nIt's another beginner-friendly tournament, this time with a slightly larger cardpool. We'll still be making some decks beforehand for people to borrow and proxy cards are absolutely legal, so if you're interested have a look at the Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/183972975885439/). Also, if you're interested in learning Netrunner, come to Casual Card Games and our veteran Netrunners will be very happy to teach you. Are we running these just to spite the people that call it a dead game? Maybe...\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nYay, boardgames is in a normal room now! Otherwise things are just like last week.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, B2.04/5 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R3.41 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in OC0.05 Oculus Building\r\n\r\nAs always, if you're looking for RPG one-shots or campaigns, please check out our [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/). We'll highlight any big ones on our RPGs Facebook group and in the newsletter as well, just like last week!\r\n\r\n## What happened this week?\r\nWe ran another Postgrad Boardgames session in the duck! It was good, people turned up. Unfortunately we don't have any photos of the event but that's obviously because everyone that turned up was a vampire and not because we forgot to take any.\r\nSpeaking of vampires, I ran my Big Dracula one-shot last week! The party explored a haunted house while making great reality TV and only half of them died - one of them while flirting with Dracula (you might have questions, but I have more) and another in a heroic, selfless attack. Dread is quite a mean system it turns out! The biggest thanks go to my players who were willing to try out something a bit different from your run-of-the-mill RPG and created some of the most interesting characters I've seen for a long time.\r\nCallum ran the D&D one-shot Assault on Gumdrop Mountain, where the party discovered that centipedes are just evil. There was an old man possessed by a centipede, then the party was ambushed by eight more centipedes and nearly died. They got to a nearby town despite the centipedes and headed up the mountain, which had dogs made of pretzels instead. It turns out that having 5 INT ends up making you chaotic questionable as despite the fact all the desserts are hallucinations, our treasurer Nathan ate so much he nearly suffocated. Also people prayed to a cake (me irl). All in all, a successful adventure!\r\nAlso in today's \"who won draft corner\" Alex (not to be confused with Aleksa, our Draft Rep) won last week's draft! I don't know what deck was played, but I expect it was a good one given the whole winning the draft thing.\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)",

There'll be lots of them, we promise. Like, thirty six hours of them - that's twenty eight more than our usual Wednesday session!\r\n\r\n### The Termly Quiz (Friday 30th November 6-8:30pm, OC1.09)\r\nIt's the first quiz with Ares at the helm after the tyrannical rule of Dan. So expect many questions from them and the rest of the exec about a variety of topics - previous rounds include countdown conundrums, bad paintings and Nigel's \"Get the name of the thing from pictures which spell out something that's not it but something that rhymes with it\" round. Not only do we have our usual prizes but we also have some trophies provided by [The Pocket Workshop](https://thepocketworkshop.co.uk), a local fantasy miniatures printing company. Look at them! They're cool dragons. Afterwards we'll be going to Varsity too.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nIt's literally the same rooms as last week! You can't say we don't make it easy for you.\r\n \r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, B2.04/5 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R3.41 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in OC0.05 Oculus Building\r\n\r\nAs always, if you're looking for RPG one-shots or campaigns, please check out our [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/). We'll highlight any big ones on our RPGs Facebook group and in the newsletter as well!\r\n\r\n## What happened this week?\r\nSo a dog was bought to boardgames and it was the highlight of my week! He's called Murphy, he's eight years old and I rate him 14/10. Most importantly I GOT TO PET HIM AND IT WAS GREAT. If the idea of a cute dog coming to boardgames doesn't make you more likely to come to boardgames, I don't know what will. There's even a photo, look at him he's so cute oh my goodness. Surprisingly boardgames wasn't just people swooning over a dog, with a group taking five hours and ten minutes to ...concede a game of Diplomacy.\r\nWe also ran a second Netrunner tournament! After many close calls at previous tournaments Lawful Tim finally went and won one, usurping his Netrunner teacher (me) for which I will never forgive him (maybe). Regardless, it was a well-earned win with him winning five of the six games he played.\r\nFinally, it turns out that people quite like Dread, to the point that after the Big Dracula one-shot last week another Wednesday Dread session was run, in which Lawful Tim wasn't so lawful after finding out that he'd killed someone. Hashtag relatable. Either way, Dread is a really fun system and I'd recommend trying it out, I mean, who doesn't want to play Death Jenga?\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n![WHAT A GOOD BOY](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/cute-dog!!!.jpg)\r\nI GOT TO PET HIM AND HE'S SO GREAT\r\n\r\n![Quiz tropies](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/quiz-trophies-1.JPG)\r\nSuper cool 3D quiz trophies.\r\n\r\n![Tim, the winner of the Modded Netrunner tournament](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/modded-tournament-win.jpg)\r\nTim won the tournament so gets some nice art and most importantly a mention in the newsletter.",

Netrunner has event cards, so does this make it a Netrunner deck? But isn't the Deck of Many Things from D&D which is notably not Netrunner? Maybe this is the start of a beautiful crossover game where you get to hack into servers but you're a magician pulling out hacking tricks from a deck of cards. And some of those tricks will give you untold riches while others will take your soul from your body, but if you forget a line of code it won't compile and you won't hack in successfully.\r\n\r\n...or maybe I'm just stretching this joke a bit thin. Let's get on with the news!\r\n\r\n## Special Events\r\n### Tabletop Weekend 2: Electric Boogaloo (10am Saturday 1st December - 10pm Sunday 2nd December, B2.02)\r\nAfter many weeks of advertising it, it's finally here! Much gaming, much takeaway, much fun. The only thing people may be not getting much of is sleep. Or work done. [Editor's Note: This is too real, stop.]\r\nAlso, people still seem to be hungry for Diplomacy to the point where a group including our Board Games Rep Patrick are planning to play it during the weekend - signups for that can be found [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/72/). But don't worry if that's not your thing, as there will be many other games played too. Will Two Rooms and a Boom happen at 2am? How many games of Dinosaur Island will be played? There's only one way to find out. Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1950750388567236/)!\r\n\r\n### The Termly Quiz (Friday 30th November 6-8:30pm, OC1.09)\r\nIf you were at boardgames last week you'll have hopefully seen the beautiful dragon trophies perched on the wall and thought \"hmm, I'd love to win one of those\". Conveniently, this Friday is your chance! All you have to do is answer a bunch of mean questions set by the exec. Easy, right? Also our former Communications Officer John is doing a bonus round and you're in for a treat, if you like being confused by completely ridiculous questions that nobody will ever get right (don't worry though, there are sensible rounds as well). We'll be going to Varsity afterwards too for a post-quiz social. There's even a Facebook event which you can find [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/364719381003126/).\r\n\r\n### CCGs Tournament (Thursday 29th November 7-10pm, H2.44)\r\nWe're hosting a joint CCGs tournament with Coventry University's gaming society on home turf in the Humanities Building. So if you play Yu-Gi-Oh or Modern, this is the place to show off your skills! Note that unlike in our regular Casual Card Games sessions proxy and counterfeit cards are not allowed. Also note this is really two simultaneous tournaments, you don't spend half the time playing Modern and the other half playing Yu-Gi-Oh, or even play both simultaneously. Hey, this could be the start of a beautiful crossover game where you tap lands to synchro summon from your sideboard and... [Editor's Note: Stop.]\r\n\r\n### CompSoc's 3D Printing Talk (Tuesday 27th November 6pm, MSB0.07)\r\nThe Computing Society are doing a talk on 3D printing and the services they provide (aka a 3D printer) for you to do that! This event is open to all (including non-members of CompSoc) so if you've wondered how you can print some cool figures for your next RPG session or some replacement board game pieces, this is likely the talk for you. Also there's **free pizza** which makes me very sad that I can't go. Details on Facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/2197845097100035/).\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nThe rooms are still the same!

Tim's one-shot sign ups are now up [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/75/) as well as sign-ups for Alex's homebrew slightly festive one-shot running on Wednesday [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/74/).\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nUnfortunately this newsletter isn't becoming dog news as there wasn't a cute dog at boardgames last week, but hey maybe there'll be one this week. My personal highlight of the week thought was the game Identik which our RPG Rep Callum found in a charity shop for \u00a33. The elevator pitch of Identik is that one player has to describe a piece of art in ninety seconds and everyone else has to draw it. Its slogan is \"A drawing game for people that don't know how to draw\" but I don't know what they're talking about, the art drawn on Wednesday was wonderful - you can see some of it below! None of the artists wanted to be attributed to their work because they thought they'd make people too jealous.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope that everyone's terms are going well! We're approaching the end of term surprisingly quickly and while this is the point where everything can get very stressful, but hopefully our usual events can be a nice break from all of that.\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n![\"Flat Tire\"](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/identik-1.jpg)\r\nThis is a more abstract piece commenting on the weight we carry in society.\r\n\r\n![Sassy artist drawing](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/identik-2.jpg)\r\nThis piece shows a sassy artist who is particularly done with the bird that he's trying to draw.\r\n\r\n![Tabletop weekend poster](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/tabletop-weekend-fb-banner-graffiti.png)\r\nAres didn't have access to their tablet so I had to step in to make this poster...\r\n\r\n![Quiz night poster](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/quiznight.png)\r\nQuiz!",

Well, that's a very specific thought but I've got very good news for you, they are now available from the SU's website! It's even available to non-members, ooh. Adorned with our full society name on the right and a three line, twenty characters per line customisation on the left, you can own a unique part of society history, for one small payment of \u00a323.50! Also it's got our logo on the back. You can get them from [here](https://www.warwicksu.com/shop/product/10157490/) until January 14th.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nOh no, the rooms have changed! It's the end of the world! Wait it's just the end of term never mind.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R3.41 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** is not happening this week!\r\n\r\nAs always, if you're looking for RPG one-shots or campaigns, please check out our [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/). We'll endeavour to mention any big ones, as always, but given it's the end of term not much more is going to be run probably.\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\n~~Nothing much really.~~ We ran a tournament with Coventry Uni's gaming society, in which much Modern (Magic: The Gathering) and Yu-Gi-Oh was played, albeit as two separate games (nobody took my great idea for combining the two games seriously... I'll just go to Dragon's Den and reap the profits instead). Both tournaments were won by players from Coventry (Modern by Marco and Yu-Gi-Oh by Luke), which is of course unforgivable and will start a ten-thousand year long card game-based war. We gave it a good fight though, with our only Yu-Gi-Oh player Hadib coming third and Warwick's Magic players claiming third through to sixth in the Modern tournament. All in all, a success!\r\n\r\nFriday started off the weekend strong with our quiz, which was won by the team *\"uh, hm\"*. They successfully navigated through things that rhyme with things but aren't the thing (not being distracted by one of the questions involving the holy binity of recycling, garden waste and other waste), minimalist art, Jeopardy and more! They won some cool dragon trophies and other neat stuff. The biggest thanks go to Ares for organising such a successful event and the other exec that wrote quiz rounds!\r\n\r\nThe tabletop weekend was a wonderful mess of tabletop games, including the fated game of Diplomacy. Seven countries started the game, only one finished after a few concessions and the German empire just sort of disappearing, whoops. I played as part of a team with Callum, playing Austria-Hungary (I was Hungary of course) and we were kind of wiped out about half way through the game but that's not important. One of the highlights of my weekend was playing Root (thanks Captain!), in which Patrick as the Arbiter became allies with the ruling cats, then lead them away from their base leaving it vulnerable. Also the birds had difficulties after an ambush left them unable to build, causing their entire government to collapse. Just one of those days, huh? The weekend also included the End of Term LARP, which our LARP Rep Jakup summarised as \"Morgan Simnel, an important NPC, got shot and killed but not really\". I'm intrigued!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you enjoyed the week as much as I did! This coming week is a bit less exciting (perhaps for the best, it was kind of exhausting!), but hopefully the usual events will be enough to tide people over before the holidays start. I don't know how this term has gone so quickly to be honest, but there'll be one more newsletter next week so don't be afeared, I'll be back next week with hopefully some exciting news related to a certain bird Pok\u00e9mon...\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n\r\n![Hoodie orders](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/hoodie-order.png)\r\nGet your hoodies from the SU website until January 14th!\r\n\r\n![The winners of the quiz, \"uh, hm\"!](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/quiz-win.jpg)\r\nThe winners of the quiz, \"uh, hm\"!\r\n\r\n![Tabletopopolis News](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/dinopark.png)\r\nNews from Tabletop Weekend!",

A short animation plays on the screen - images of dice slide across the screen with a twenty-sided one dropping into some rocky ground and being pierced by a sword, forming the society logo. \"Tabletopopolis News\" appears around said logo, and then all fades to reveal a news studio. A figure sits at the news desk, tapping their fingers on the desk in an extremely bored fashion. As the camera pans to face them, they jolt into position as if they've only just realised they're on air.]\r\n\r\n**Finnbar**: Uh... hello, and welcome to Tabletopopolis News, it's Monday! Ughhhhhhhhh. Our top stories this week!\r\n\r\n## What's happening during the holiday?\r\n**Finnbar**: Despite the end of term and the apocalypse at the weekend, the society still seems to be going strong, with three events being run (mostly) weekly during the holidays.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames**: Mondays 5pm-10pm, WCE0.10 in weeks 11 and 12.\r\n* **Board Games**: Wednesdays 4pm-10pm, WCE0.10 in weeks 11, 12 and 14.\r\n* **Casual Card Games**: Thursdays 5pm-10pm, WCE0.10 in weeks 11, 12 and 14.\r\n\r\nAlso, the hoodie order is still open until January 14th, so head over to the [SU store](https://www.warwicksu.com/shop/product/10157490/) to grab one while you've still got a chance!\r\n\r\nOtherwise, there aren't any special events over the holidays, so you'll just have to make your own I guess. I've heard there's this thing called Christmas where you like see your family and stuff and give presents to people? Sounds good, but also like capitali-\r\n\r\n## RPG Intros: Ultimate (Saturday 12th January 2019)\r\n**Finnbar**: Actually we're going to have to pause being confused because we've got some breaking news about a special event - a new fighter has appeared!\r\n\r\n![CALLUM RUNS RPG INTROS](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/smash-small.png)\r\n\r\nThat's right, keep your calendars open for the Saturday of week one, because it'll be fun RPG intro times! Whether you'd like to try D&D for the first time or you're already big on RPGs and just wanna play another one-shot, there'll be something running for you to try. In other RPG news, we now own some extra RPG resources which you can borrow - check Callum's [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WarwickRPGs/permalink/297293450896833/) for all the details.\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\n**Finnbar**: And now we have a special report from our Apocalypse correspondent, Nigel.\r\n\r\n**Nigel**: Thanks, Finnbar. A slightly smaller 40k apocalypse than usual, colloquially known as a \u2018mishap\u2019 among those in the know, the spectacle was nonetheless magnificent, with hundreds of fully painted models making up the lines of both sides. In one corner, the Grey Knights and Imperial Guard and on the other, the Ultramarines, the Necrons and more Ultramarines. Commander Shelton was the first to mourn, for his mighty Falchion super-heavy-tank, destroyed before it could fire a shot after team Grey Guard seized the initiative. Though the Ultracronmarines stayed in the game for a while, with one brave scout surviving a platoon-sized firing squad for three turns on one of the objectives, the death of Roboute Guilliman to a snap-shooting Vanquisher cannon and that of Marneus Calgar to the squeezing Thunderstrike gauntlet of an imperial knight led brought the game to its conclusion. Victory goes to the Greyguard with a final score of 15-13! Nigel Heathcote, Tabletopopolis News, WCE.09a.\r\n\r\n**Finnbar**: Thanks, Nigel. Seems like a successful apocalypse was had by all! Otherwise, the events this week were relatively normal, with many games played despite the marathon of games a week ago. Questionable things were said during Deception and Concept (have a look at the quotes on Discord (which has the code `pCSfTsR` if you're not already on there) if you're... interested), and one of the Monikers expansions was opened which included the full title of [Idi Amin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin#Erratic_behaviour,_self-bestowed_titles_and_media_portrayal) which it turns out is impossible to recite from memory. Briefly before we end, we go to the weather:\r\n\r\n[We pan to the weather reporter, staring directly at the camera.]\r\n\r\n**Weather Reporter**: DON'T GO OUTSIDE IT'S COLD\r\n\r\n[They continue to stare.]\r\n\r\n**Finnbar**: ...aaaaanyway, I hope you all have a wonderful holiday and look forward to seeing you on the other side, with hopefully various bits of exciting start-of-term news.

      "body": "[EDIT: whoops I got the week wrong...]\r\n\r\nHi everyone! I hope you all had a wonderful holiday and are ready for some great gaming! Here's a powerful bumper newsletter to start off your term right. In fact, it is so powerful that most of it was actually written for the start of last term's newsletter but was rejected for being too good (okay maybe not for that reason but still). Just don't tell the Newsletter Police I'm doing this otherwise they'll be at my door saying stuff like \"you can't unleash such power!\" and \"it's too long, nobody will read it!\". They'll never know. Heh.\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n### RPG Introductory One Shots: Ultimate (Saturday 12pm, Social Sciences Caf\u00e9)\r\nIt's the return of RPG introductory one-shots! After the great success of last term's one-shots we're running it again, so whether you've never played before or could recite the entire D&D Player's Handbook from memory join us from midday in the Social Sciences Caf\u00e9. There will be many sessions being run for beginners and experts alike, so just come on down, pick a session and have some fun! If you're interested there's a Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/2013309035405670/) and signups on our website [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/78/). If you want to run a session, have a gander at this [forum thread](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/239/) where you can see what's being run and post your intentions. Also, afterwards we'll be going to **Varsity at 7pm** for a pub social - join us even if you were unable to make the sessions themselves!\r\n\r\n### Hoodies\r\nIt's cold outside, and you have to leave the house. Would you rather leave in a boring, drab coat with no dice on it and look boring and normal, or would you rather leave in an amazing personalised portable hug also known as a hoodie? Feel warm and cool at the same time by showing off your love of the society and three twenty character lines of whatever reasonable text you like (terms and conditions apply). You can immortalise what happened in that one D&D session, show off your sweet internet handle so everyone can check out your cool art, or even put your credit card number and mother's maiden name on there! You've got until January 14th to place your order [here](https://www.warwicksu.com/shop/product/10157490/) so don't delay.\r\n\r\n## What happened over the holidays?\r\nPeople still played games! We ran Wargames, Boardgames and CCGs over the holidays (except during Christmas week when you're supposed to see family or something), but most importantly ran another great session of Postgrad Boardgames at the Dirty Duck. Despite the lack of food, much fun was had and an intense game of Explorers of Ixalan was played with some sneaky vampires piloted by the Overlord of Spooky themselves (Ares) winning overall. Sneaky.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nWe've got our usual set of weekly events with extra RPG goodness, but because it's the bumper newsletter I get to talk through and make jokes about each event in turn. Let's get started with... **oh my goodness there's been a terrible murder**.\r\n\r\n[Police sirens blare, cop show music plays. We pan to the image of two figures in the police station, files in hand.]\r\n**Detective Bar**: What we got, Captain?\r\n**Captain Finn**: There's been a terrible murder.\r\n**Bar**: Yeah, I got that from the title, Finnbar's free time's been murdered. Who are our suspects?\r\n**Finn**: Well, there's a society at the university the victim goes to that runs a lot of events, maybe something happened there.\r\n**Bar**: Could they perhaps have lots of weekly events that could have caused this to happen?\r\n**Finn**: Maybe we should walk through all of the events that are happening to ~~advertise things~~ work out what happened.\r\n\r\n### Wargames (Monday 5pm, B2.01 Science Concourse)\r\n**Bar**: Ah, wargames. They're likely pretty big on murder, given the whole fighting battles thing. So a good motive.\r\n**Finn**: I see, but they seem like a pretty friendly bunch. They've got many society armies so new players can get involved, will try basically any wargame, and are particularly big on Warhammer, X-wing and Warmachine.\r\n**Bar**: You can see what games are being run by looking at the replies to James' (our Wargames rep) weekly Facebook post in the [Wargames Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WarwickWargames/), and reply with whatever games you're interested in playing.\r\n**Finn**: We should look at the post for the time of the murder to work out who had an alibi. Okay, who's next?\r\n\r\n### Magic: The Gathering Draft (Tuesday 6pm, B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\n**Bar**: How much is murdered free time worth? Magic can get quite expensive.\r\n**Finn**: Probably couldn't sell it for much at the pawnshop, but that's okay because the draft is cheap! Wait a minute, it's not cheap this week.\r\n**Bar**: What, but it's normally \u00a38 reduced by \u00a32 per pack you bring, which is very cheap. But this week it's [squints at notes]... \u00a330?\r\n**Finn**: I see, they're drafting the Ultimate Masters set.\r\n**Bar**: how did you work that out? I only told you the price...\r\n**Finn**: It's the set with some of the most powerful cards from Magic history brought back for you to draft! With that extra price comes extra quality.\r\n**Bar**: It's also important to note that this and next week's drafts have signups and limited capacity, so you should go to the [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) to sign up. Currently this week's one is full, and a regular draft is **not** being run so don't turn up unless you've signed up. Next week's Ultimate Masters draft still has spaces though.\r\n**Finn**: \u00a330, though, that's a lot. I guess the cards are powerful. Anyway, it's not all about the money, it's about the friends you made along the way.\r\n**Bar**: The friends... hmm.\r\n\r\n### Boardgames (Wednesday 2pm, B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\n**Bar**: The boardgames people are particularly lovely, it can't have been them.\r\n**Finn**: But what if that's what they *want* you to think? Have you ever played Avalon? Have you ever sat there as Merlin trying to get your stupid team to realise that the bad guys are sitting right there in the corner of the table openly talking about being bad but nobody is taking them seriously because they're all too busy saying that you know too much despite the fact you've said basically nothing and they just won't see that it's so obvious I mean look at them they may as well have a neon sign above their heads saying \"BAD GUYS OVER HERE\" seriously wh-\r\n**Bar**: are you okay\r\n**Finn**: i'm bad at social deduction games\r\n**Bar**: We know, Finn, it's okay.\r\n**Finn**: Anyway, they boast a huge collection, ranging from simple, fun party games to session-long epics, and are big on welcoming new people! There'll be members of the society exec there to teach and suggest games too. The session runs from 2pm until 10pm and you can drop in and stay as long as you like.\r\n**Bar**: I guess that's another alibi then - eight hours is a long time, and leaves too little time for committing a murder.\r\n\r\n### Casual Card Games (Thursday 4pm, R0.12 Ramphal Building)\r\n**Bar**: This is where all the card game players meet. There's always some cards being drawn, attacks being declared, topdecks being topdecked. This is where the King of Games is decided. That being said, it's a very casual environment open to proxies and whatever decks you bring, as long as you talk to your opponent about it beforehand.\r\n**Finn**: It's the place to go if you're looking for games of Commander (Magic: The Gathering's multiplayer format), Netrunner or Yu-Gi-Oh. If you want to learn one of the aforementioned games there are many demo decks available to borrow and many players who are happy to teach the games they love, so don't feel you have to be an expert to join.\r\n**Bar**: That's all good and friendly, but could they be the murderer?\r\n**Finn**: Given how much time you can sink into those games? Nah.\r\n\r\n### Introductory Roleplaying Games (Saturday 12pm, Social Sciences Caf\u00e9)\r\n**Finn**: It's the return of the RPG introductory one-shots! Hang on I've got an immense feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\r\n**Bar**: Yeah, it's almost as if this has been talked about already very recently and this section is just a friendly reminder that it's gonna be really good, so you should sign up to go to it.\r\n**Finn**: I guess all that's left to say is that for your non introductory one-shot needs you should turn your attention to the [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) on the website where campaigns and other one-shots looking for people will be advertised.\r\n**Bar**: Did they commit the murder though?\r\n**Finn**: Probably not, those sessions last almost as long as the board games session, so likely lack time for such a murder.\r\n\r\n### Live Action Roleplaying (Sunday 12pm, B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\n**Bar**: So, LARP. You get to fight! In armour! And you can join whether you're new and wanna try it out or could beat Jakub (our LARP rep) in an actual sword fight. Just turn up to B2.02 at midday ready to don some society kit and head out for good roleplaying times. Not sure they would commit a murder though.\r\n**Finn**: BAR THEY HAVE LITERAL FOAM WEAPONS AND ARMOUR\r\n**Finn**: HOW IS IT NOT THEM\r\n**Bar**: I feel like I'd be pretty exhausted after a LARP session, let alone have the energy for a murder afterwards.\r\n\r\n**Finn**: Then who did it, Detective? You've determined that basically every part of the society couldn't have done it, they're too busy.\r\n**Bar**: But what if it wasn't just one part of the society?\r\n**Finn**: ...what do you mean?\r\n**Bar**: Elementary, my dear Bar. It wasn't just part of the society - it was the friends we made along the way!\r\n**Finn**: what\r\n**Finn**: ...how are we going to arrest all those friends though\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)",

Zatu Games are an online board games retailer with over 13,000 games including a vast range of pre-orders and Kickstarters. They offer everything from short party games like Codenames to the ridiculous hugeness of Gloomhaven all at competitive prices. So keep your eye out for some Zatu-stickered games coming to a board games session near you! Their site can be found [here](https://www.board-game.co.uk/).\r\n\r\n### Term 2 Week 5 Tabletop Weekend (10am February 9th - 10pm February 10th, B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\n36 hours of gaming fun! We've got B2.02 booked for the entire weekend (including overnight) so join us for as long as you'd like. It's the perfect chance to try out games you've not had the chance to in regular sessions or even games from a part of the society you've not been able to go to. This will be just like any of our other events in that there'll be exec around to suggest and teach games, so even if you've only attended a few of our events before this is one that's not to be missed! Also, LARP will still be running during the weekend too so you can treat it as a LARP sandwich with boardgaming bread, if that's your jam.\r\n\r\n### Annual General Meeting (6pm Wednesday 27th February, LIB1)\r\nWe'll be having our Annual General Meeting during week 8's Boardgames session, where motions about how the society is run will be proposed, debated and voted on. We will also be electing the next year's exec, so if you'd like to become part of the exec this is your chance to run! I'm sure if you're interested in running for a certain role the incumbent exec member will be happy to tell you about what it entails and offer advice. We'll have more details about this soon (including threads on the website for proposing motions and stating your intent to run for exec), so please keep that Wednesday evening free as we need enough people to turn up so we can function as a society for another year.\r\n\r\n![AGM Poster](https://www.finnbar.me/static/AGM-2019-small.png)\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nIt's a pretty normal week here at Tabletop HQ, with the usual events being run and the rooms being exactly the same as last week.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n\r\nRemember that this week's Magic draft is still Ultimate Masters, so you need to have signed up to the event [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/80/)! And it's still \u00a330. Premium cards mean premium prices!\r\nAlso, if you're looking for RPG one-shots or campaigns, please check out our [Events page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/). All campaigns and one-shots looking for players can be found there, including a very recently announced D&D oneshot running this Friday, for which you can find the signups on our website [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/82/). Tim's D&D oneshots have returned for this term as well, starting with [this one](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/83/) running this weekend. Gosh, so much choice! (As long as you like D&D...)\r\n\r\n## What happened this week?\r\nWe ran the sequel to Introductory RPGs! It was a great success with many sessions being run. There was a lot of D&D including a heist with six rogues that *definitely* didn't go off track, and a 16th level adventure including a character that multiclassed into literally every class in the game. Some more obscure systems were run as well though - I ran Lasers and Feelings, a very simple system in which the party successfully prevented reality from being destroyed by blowing up a national heritage site.\r\n\r\nThe craziest things happened though in Era Lyres (run by Callum although it's quite collaborative), a system in which rather than being actual adventurers, players pretend to be adventurers and tell their totally legit tales of all the great adventures they totally had. They first persuaded a bard that they were great adventurers but then the bard decided he'd follow the party around and sing great songs about their adventures (and would very quickly find out these adventures didn't exist)... so they got him elected as mayor so he would be too busy. They also found a chain restaurant called Naandos, where you could order an overnight slow cooked chicken. Unfortunately it was in a very northern part of the world so they ended up cooking it for six months, but it tasted so good by the end that it was definitely worth the wait.\r\n\r\nIn boardgames Callum brought in the game Catacombs, a mad dexterity dungeon crawler where a party including a chicken, Patrick the Worst Barbarian Ever (his words, not mine) and an armadillo (which did a whole **two** damage, wow, MVP right there) explored a dungeon but then got killed by a Lich King. Alas.\r\n\r\nFinally we had an exec meeting and in an attempt to be more transparent about how the society is run we're advertising the exec meeting minutes (which were already publicly available [in this thread](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/16/) but still) - this week we discussed the upcoming AGM and the introductory RPGs, for which you can find the minutes [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/249/).\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\nDiscord Shortlink: `xdDZnYQ`\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n[Our Sponsors, Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)",

We will hopefully reach Alpha Centauri soon, but for now, I'll just look at cute cat pictures on the internet. There was one today with a really bushy tai-\r\n\r\n[A huge crash is heard from a nearby window.]\r\n\r\n**Finnbar**: [brushing glass off themselves, notably not wearing a spacesuit] LET'S SEE WHAT NEWS WE HAVE THIS WEEK!\r\n**Captain Panic**: HOW ARE YOU EVEN ALIVE?!\r\n[Alarms sound as oxygen leaves the ship through the new hole in the window.]\r\n**Captain Panic**: HOW AM I EVEN ALIVE?!\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n### Term 2 Week 5 Tabletop Weekend (10am February 9th - 10pm February 10th, B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\nIt's been a week since this was last mentioned, which means it's a week closer to Tabletop Weekend! Wow, how time flies. Anyway, it's still the thirty six hours of gaming you know and love in B2.02, so come on down and drop in for as long or as little as you'd like. There'll be all kinds of games and it'll just be a nice atmosphere to relax in partway through term! Also 1am Two Rooms and a Boom is not to be missed unless you're me and can't function without lots of sleep (yes, I'm weak).\r\n\r\n### Annual General Meeting (6pm Wednesday 27th February, LIB1)\r\nBecause the AGM is so important (please turn up), I've decided to start a new section of the newsletter called **Fun Facts About The AGM**! Each week up until the AGM I'll provide a fun fact about this society's history and the AGM. My first fun fact to impart to you is that there is now a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/528557110974732/) for the AGM as well as a useful thread of [FAQs](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/252/) written by our excellent secretary Ares and a [thread](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/253/) for nominating yourself to be exec and suggest motions. Anyway, tune in next week for more **Fun Facts About The AGM**! [outro music plays]\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nThe rooms are still the same... it's a miracle! There will be more excitement next week though with one whole room change, wow.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n\r\nMagic: The Gathering Draft is much cheaper than last week by virtue of being free, as we've not got the new set yet so people will likely be cube drafting. Keep an eye out on the [CCGs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/) for more info!\r\nIn RPGs land, the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) is home to a few new events - a [Lord of the Rings Campaign](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/84/) and a special one-shot featuring an [RPG system](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/85/) that uses voting in place of dice rolls for checks! And I expect Tim's weekly one-shot will be up there soon enough. You're actually spoiled for choice this week, madness.\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nIt's got to that part of term where not many special events have really been happening, so I don't have much to share with you. Fortunately boardgames always has some quotable happenings so let's get right to it. Food Chain Magnate was played to its completion for the first time, with the group of fast food restaurants with possibly questionable morals fostering a corner of beer-lovers in a quiet city to make a massive profit.\r\n\r\nA new way to spend the last hour of so of boardgames was also found - learning the rules of games! No wait come back, I'm serious - a small group of us had a pleasant time learning the rules to Last Will, an extremely silly game about spending all of your money so that your dead uncle gives you more money. Now that we've learned the rules, we can try it out for real next week without having to work it out again! Would recommend. Also some people played Bananagrams and Cara earned honorary second place for the pictured grid. It's... impressive.\r\n\r\nAlso the society archeologists have dug up some more evidence of the legend of the Timforce which is now extended with the three tenets of student life: being tired, hungry and poor. Lawful Tim, who you may know as Tim Hutchinson, turns out to also be Hungry Tim (I can attest to this, I live with him); Chaotic Tim, or Timothy Smith, is Tired Tim; and finally, we have found a reason for not being able to find Neutral Tim - he is Poor Tim, so cannot afford society membership, and doesn't realise that you don't need society membership to turn up to our events! But supporting us is great and you still get a lovely society-branded die (and the ability to vote in the upcoming AGM).\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\nDiscord Shortlink: `xdDZnYQ`\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n[Our Sponsors, Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n![Bananagrams board, featuring both \"yeet\" and \"meme\"](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/bananagrams-yeet.jpg)\r\nThis Bananagrams board is perhaps cursed",

One of them begins to monologue.]\r\n**Kaiba**: This duel is mine, Yugi! You see, I've had help from a mysterious figure wearing a purple hoodie who gave me \"the most powerful card in all of Yu-Gi-Oh\" so that I can defeat you! And with my magic card, I should be able to find it! I activate Pot of Greed, which allows me to draw two additional cards from my deck, thus increasing the number of options in my hand!\r\n[He throws down Pot of Greed, and dramatically draws the two cards, holding them up in the air before adding them to his hand. Lightning bolts fly and dramatic music plays.]\r\n**Kaiba**: Aha! I found it! Prepare to be defeated, Yugi! I play the most powerful card of all... The Newsletter!!\r\n[He slams down a card called The Newsletter on his Duel Disk.

Join us at any time during the weekend of week five in B2.02 for all the gaming you could imagine, or at least all the gaming you can fit in. I'm beginning to train for this by weightlifting with the board games I have at home (that'll definitely make me better at gaming) and balancing a variety of things on other things to prepare for games like Junkart. There's even a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/766083783779004/) now so you can tell all your friends about how great a weekend you'll be having, wow.\r\n\r\n### Annual General Meeting (6pm Wednesday 27th February, LIB1)\r\nWelcome back to **Fun Facts About The AGM**, a great new segment I introduced in last week's newsletter. This week's fun fact is about one of the motions introduced just last year. Back in the Olden Days, our President was in fact called the Presidential Spokesbeing, with the President being very similar to our Mascot position. Past \"Presidents\" included Brian Blessed and Hypnotoad, but our current mascot is R.O.N. because we felt bad that he'd run for literally every exec position and never got in. Congrats on finally winning something, R.O.N., but your term will be coming to an end soon - we'll be electing a new mascot during the AGM. Anyway, here's your weekly reminder of the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/528557110974732/) where you can find all of the useful details.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nThe miracle of rooms staying the same each week has alas ended, with a seismic shift moving Boardgames to the Physics Common Room... on the fifth floor of Physics. Seems like I shouldn't have skipped leg day while weightlifting board games, that's a whole lotta stairs. Please note that you can get to the Physics Common Room is via the stairs partway through the Science Concourse, not the stairs on the side closest to the library!\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, **P5.64** Science Concourse (Physics Common Room)\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n\r\nWe've now got a box of Ravnica Allegiance in now so that will be being drafted during the Magic Draft for the usual price of \u00a38 (reduced by \u00a32 per pack you bring). For your RPG needs, please check out the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) as always - Tim's usual weekly one-shot event has just been put up [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/88/).\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nSpirit Island is a game I don't have much experience in, but it definitely seems like a dramatic one. This week I walked up to it to see what happened, and the following conversation ensued:\r\n\r\n**Josh Raffles** (CCGs Rep): I did a thing.\r\n**Finnbar**: What did you do?\r\n**Josh**: That. [Points at a quarter of the island that's now on a different table.]\r\n**Finnbar**: What.\r\n\r\nSo it turns out you can just sink a quarter of the island. Huh. Josh then proceeded to one-up himself by sinking another quarter of the island. Can't have a corrupted island if there's no island, I guess.\r\n\r\nAlso, Tim ran a Netrunner tournament (which I couldn't make it to...) won by Sam Coy, who won the first tournament back in term 1. He seems to be quite good at this tournament winning business. Tim seems to have had a particularly busy weekend as he also ran his usual one-shot, in which the party (including a blindfolded wizard/cleric that could see via his owl) tried to solve a murder but had to deal with a variety of foes including arcane glyphs that seemed to be designed by the most sadistic of engineers (aka Tim).\r\n\r\nFinally, I bought an adorable shark cuddly toy from IKEA yesterday and need a name for it. If you've got any ideas, please put them in the comments or message them to me in some other way!\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\nDiscord Shortlink: `xdDZnYQ`\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n[Our Sponsors, Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n![Spirit Island, half sunk](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/spirit-island-sunk.jpg)\r\nA handy diagram explaining which parts of Spirit Island are sunk and which aren't.\r\n\r\n![Tabletop Weekend Poster](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/tabletop-weekend-term-2-week-5-small.png)\r\nIt's nearly week five, so you get an excellent poster drawn by our talented artist Ares!",

Footsteps. A figure in a purple hoodie appears next to you.]\r\n**Finnbar**: I finally found someone in this ship! I can tell you about all the great news from this week!\r\n[...This is worse than being eaten.]\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n### Term 2 Week 5 Tabletop Weekend (10am Saturday - 10pm Sunday, B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\nIt's finally here! Thank goodness, I'm running out of ways to rehash the description of it for every edition of the newsletter. Fortunately I remembered that lists exist, so here are the important points: Games! In a room! Thirty-six hours! B2.02! All that's left to say now is that the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/766083783779004/) still exists if you're one of those people that are big on social media.\r\n\r\n### Game Design Collaboration - Build Your Own Board Game! (10am 23rd February - 5pm 24th February, LIB2)\r\nDo you wanna build a ~~snowman~~ board game? Well, now's your chance! In collaboration with the Game Design society we're running a game jam, an event in which you have a day and a half (from 11am on the Saturday to 3pm on the Sunday) to get into teams and make a game on a theme we'll reveal at the start of the event. This sounds like a daunting task, but it's very fun and there'll be help in the form of a talk from Game Design about making games and a talk from me about great boardgame mechanics (that you can steal ideas from!) just before the jam from 10-11am on the Saturday. After the end of the jam (3pm on the Sunday) we'll have time for playtesting - please come along to try out the new games made during the jam even if you're not able to make the rest of the event! Finally, Game Design have a tradition of going to Nando's in Coventry after their game jams so there'll be a chance for a nice meal afterwards. We'll have a Facebook event made soon with all the details.\r\n\r\n### Annual General Meeting (6pm Wednesday 27th February, LIB1)\r\nWelcome back to **Fun Facts About The AGM**, a great new segment I introduced to the newsletter two weeks ago and regret intensely because I'm already scraping the bottom of the barrel for facts! This episode of **Fun Facts about the AGM** has been loved by critics including Ares, who said \"... what... is that agm fact\". High praise! Here's this week's fact: did you know that AGM is pronounced \"ayyyy! GM!\" to respect all of the times where a GM has thought of a really cool idea and has inflicted it on their players in a fun and interesting way? Anyway, here's your weekly reminder of the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/528557110974732/) where you can find all of the useful details.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nWhile the Physics Common Room was obviously a great room which was definitely not way too high up and difficult to find, we've moved to a much less exciting room this week for Boardgames in the form of LIB1.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, LIB1 (Ground Floor Library)\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n\r\nFor your RPG needs, please check out the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) as always - Tim's usual weekly one-shot event is also up, and you can sign up [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/90/).\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nThis week we tried Escape From The Aliens In Outer Space at Boardgames (the inspiration for the intro), an amazing game with an awful-sounding name involving hidden movement of humans and aliens. The humans want to get out of the spaceship via an escape pod while the aliens want to eat the humans, but unfortunately everyone's role is hidden so an alien might accidentally eat another alien. Which brings us to Jakub, possibly the world's most sympathetic alien who managed to eat two aliens and no humans, inspiring the titular quote. Fortunately he managed to avoid killing Joey, who managed to eat two humans and no aliens, thus single-handedly carrying his team of two now-dead aliens and Jakub. Also one of the other humans betrayed me by letting the aliens know where I was to distract them from his own path, the jerk.\r\n\r\nIn Nigel's Dark Heresy campaign this week, a lot happened but fortunately Detective-Arbitrator Brebb (Henry Cockett) helpfully provided some useful MS Paint drawings, which along with captions provided by Nigel explain exactly what happened! You can find these images at the bottom of the newsletter. Last week's Timshot ended excitingly as well with Medusa riding away on a fiery steed to the ethereal plane. Inconvenient, especially after a long, blindfolded battle to avoid turning to stone.\r\n\r\nFinally, I forgot to link to the exec meeting notes from week 3 in last week's newsletter, so here's a reminder that they're available [on the forum](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/256/). These include discussion of the AGM, Zatu and the Game Design collab! We also had an exec meeting last week including discussion of a possible Commander league, the quiz and more AGM stuff (it's important okay) which can be found [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/257/).\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\nDiscord Shortlink: `xdDZnYQ`\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n[Our Sponsors, Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n## The Battle Report\r\n![Part 1 of 3 of the battle report](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/report1.png)\r\nAce Pilot 'Ofelia Strol' pilots the inquisitorial Arvus Lighter to the continent of Gramias, taking the acolytes and their newly-acquired Leman Russ Demolisher with them.\r\n\r\n![Part 2 of 3 of the battle report](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/report2.png)\r\nAfter Pilot Ofelia reports that she cannot continue with aerial reconnaisance and that she'd 'explain when she gets back', speculation runs rampant among the acolytes as to the cause. Cybernetic Weapon expert Wolfe suggests a 'chaotic death tornado', pictured.\r\n\r\n![Part 3 of 3 of the battle report](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/report3.png)\r\nAfter some extensive issues with navigating the deserted wasteland of Gramias, the acolyte's russ finally reaches the abandoned base, only to be ambushed by a dark eldar raider. After being circled several times by the flickerfield-shrouded skimmer and taking heavy damage from its Dark Lance, Wolfe and his brother Corpus finally manage to successfully track the raider. Miraculously, the first shot fired by Wolfe from the Russ' demolisher cannon is a direct hit, destroying it and its crew completely - perhaps too completely.",

      "title": "Week 20 Newsletter - What Happened At Tabletop Weekend?",
      "body": "[We pan to a studio, lights spinning, audience cheering. A host in a purple hoodie sits in a large chair opposite a sofa filled with a variety of guests. A massive sign saying \"What Happened At Tabletop Weekend?\" hangs dangerously from the ceiling above said host. Music plays.]\r\n**Announcer**: Good evening everyone, it's time for another episode of What Happened At Tabletop Weekend! Please welcome your host, Finnbar!\r\n[More cheering. The host waves, looking visibly tired. Who needs makeup when you have a lack of sleep, anyway?]\r\n**Finnbar**: Hello everyone! It's great to see you all here! We've got a variety of guests here today to talk about the various happenings of the last week and things that are happening soon.\r\n[The audience goes \"ooooh\".]\r\n**Finnbar**: Also, it's National Pun Day today, I hope you have a lot of *pun*. First though, we've got a few special announcements!\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n**Finnbar**: First off, a few lucky audience members have got hoodies coming their way soon! And by lucky I mean that they ordered and paid for them. Regardless, they have arrived so those portable hugs should be in your hands soon - we'll be handing them out in our events close to B2.02 (so not CCGs or RPGs) so just turn up and we can get your hoodie to you! Or you can ask an exec before their event and they'll bring it with them.\r\n\r\n### Game Design Collaboration - Build Your Own Board Game! (10am 23rd February - 5pm 24th February, LIB2)\r\n**Finnbar**: Are you *board* of playing the same board games? Well, in collaboration with the Game Design society, we're hosting a game jam, an event where you have a day and a half (from 11am on Saturday to 3pm on Sunday) to make a game! Don't worry if you've never made a game before, as there'll be expertise from the members of Game Design and Tabletop in the form of talks on Saturday at 10am. Here's the relevant [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/401630627080670/). Even if you can't make it to the rest of the event, join us from **3-5pm on the Sunday** for playtesting the games made during the event! In fact, we have the President of Game Design, Dan Ilett, in the studio today - do you have anything to add?\r\n**Dan Ilett**: It's gonna be great!\r\n\r\n### Annual General Meeting (6pm Wednesday 27th February, LIB1)\r\n**Finnbar**: We'll have to interrupt that insightful commentary as it's now time for **Fun Facts About The AGM**! Here's this week's fact: if you don't buy your standard membership before **this Wednesday at 6pm**, the AGM ghost will come to your house and steal your ability to vote in the upcoming AGM. Also he'll make you feel a cold breeze and knock your keys on the floor. He's a bit of a jerk, but he's got an important message - please buy your standard membership before this Wednesday if you'd like to take part in the AGM! The Facebook event is [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/528557110974732/) for your perusal. In fact, we've got him in the studio today!\r\n\r\n[There's an empty space on the sofa where a ghost should be. A cold breeze passes through the studio and the giant sign swings dangerously above Finnbar, them staring as it looks like it might fall at any moment.]\r\n\r\n**Finnbar**: ...let's....move on.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\n**Finnbar**: This week, we're back in B2.02 for Boardgames! Woo. Here's a friendly reminder of where we are this week:\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n\r\nFor your RPG needs, please check out the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) as always - Tim's usual weekly one-shot event is up, and you can sign up [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/91/).\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\n**Finnbar**: Now here's where the fun really begins - tabletop weekend happened, and I was there for 28 hours, which may be too long and my supervisor may not like me for it, but that's not important as 2am Two Rooms and a Boom happened and ended anticlimactically as red team secured their victory in turn 2, whoops. There was also another game of Escape From The Aliens In Outer Space where Jakub may have been bitten by karma... or to be more precise another alien, as after his cannibalistic alien massacre last week he got eaten first as the alien this week. We've got Jakub in the studio today, how do you feel?\r\n**Jakub**: Hush.\r\n**Finnbar**: There was also a game of Here I Stand, the game advertised to run for eight hours... which ran for about three as Mike won as France on turn two. Slightly anticlimactic, but Nigel also made Scotland evaporate which is quite exciting. Callum brought Quacks of Quedlinburg after its stellar [Shut Up and Sit Down review](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/review-quacks-of-quedlinburg/). Quacks involves buying powerful ingredients and then never drawing them from your bag of bits. Many potions exploded (mainly on my side of the table) but much fun was had - I'd really recommend playing it!\r\nWe should talk about Scrawl too. Scrawl is a drawing game of Chinese Whispers where you start with a prompt and have to draw a picture for it. Then the next person has to write the prompt that they think inspired the... art, and repeat until the image gets full circle. We had a dodgy incident with a photocopier, but also created the most wholesome story about Satan's Christmas which we've provided a photo of. Finally, there was an exec meeting this week about the upcoming Game Design Collab, AGM and tabletop weekend for which you can find the minutes [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/258/).\r\nThank you to all the exec for running the event, particularly Jon who stayed overnight! Jon, have you got anything else to say about the weekend?\r\n**Jon**: I'm tired leave me alone.\r\n**Finnbar**: Thank you for that, Jon. And with that, we've reached the end of the show, goodbye for now!\r\n\r\n[Outro music plays, crowd cheering, lights dim. Finnbar falls asleep in their chair.]\r\n\r\nZzzzzzzzzz,\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\nDiscord Shortlink: `xdDZnYQ`\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n[Our Sponsors, Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n![Happy Christmas, Satan!](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/scrawl-christmas.jpg)\r\nWhat an adorable story!\r\n\r\n![Tabletop Collab](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/tt_gd_collab_small.png)\r\nThe collab poster, by Ares.",

      "body": "After some excellent games of Superfight I thought, why don't I get a Superfight character to write the newsletter? Unfortunately I don't have access to the Superfight deck right now so I'm just gonna have to make up a Superfight-like character... enter Superman, but really observant - Observant Man! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? \"Yes\", said Observant Man, looking at a bird and then a plane. Take it away, Observant Man!\r\n\r\n**Observant Man**: Hello citizens, as my news reporting friend mentioned I'm writing the newsletter this week. There are events happening. People can still collect their hoodies. Games were played. There's a meeting. The sky is blue.\r\n**Finnbar**: [trying to stay awake because observant man is so boring] observant man you're fired\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n### Game Design Collaboration - Build Your Own Board Game! (10am Saturday - 5pm Sunday, LIB2)\r\nThis weekend is your chance to try and make your own board game! In collaboration with Game Design we're running a game jam - a day and a half long event where you try to make a board game. We'll start with a pair of talks to help give you ideas at 10am on Saturday, then the actual game making time from 11am on Saturday to 3pm on Sunday. After that there'll be time for **open playtesting from 3pm - 5pm on Sunday** - even if you can't make the rest of the event, please join us to try out the new games that were created! We'll also be going to Nando's in Coventry afterwards, so that'll be nice. Here's the link to the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/401630627080670/) if that's your jam. Hope to see you there!\r\n\r\n### Annual General Meeting (6pm Wednesday 27th February, LIB1)\r\nWelcome back to **Fun Facts About The AGM**, the insightful section of the newsletter that leaves me scraping at the bottom of the barrel for definitely useful facts about our upcoming meeting! This week we have a bumper double fact edition! Our first fun fact is that there are still many roles to be filled, including CCGs Rep, Web Admin and Wargames Rep! While you can run on the day, it's much more helpful if you post your intentions earlier [in this thread](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/253/) as it helps the exec organise the AGM (and helps reassure us that there will be a next exec). I'd wholeheartedly recommend running for exec, and if you like the idea of standing for a particular position but aren't sure what it entails talk to the current exec member - I'm sure they'll be happy to answer any questions you might have!\r\n\r\nOur second fun fact is that the deadline for proposing constitutional changes is **6pm tomorrow (Tuesday 19th February)**, so get on that if you've got big ideas for the society - just post them [in this thread](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/253/). Finally, there's a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/528557110974732/) so you can tell your friends about the great AGM you'll be going to soon. Anyway, join us next week for the final episode of **Fun Facts About The AGM** with what is promised to be the most fun fact yet!\r\n\r\n### The Termly Quiz (OC0.01 Oculus Building, 6-8pm Friday 8th March)\r\nThe quiz returns for its second outing with Ares at the helm! I've heard rumours that there may be a round involving live music, so this is definitely not one to be missed (they say, looking angrily at themselves for missing the last two quizzes). Regardless, there'll be all manner of silly questions - you don't need to be some kind of University Challenge expert to have a good time. There's a Facebook event up [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/391081828349553/).\r\n\r\n### End of Term 2 Tabletop Weekend (12pm Saturday 9th March - 10pm Sunday 10th March, MR2 SUHQ and B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\nIn true end of term style, there's a Tabletop Weekend, which is a great way to reward yourself for all those deadlines you just had to deal with or a way to procrastinate if there are still a few left [Editor's Note: Oof, too real]. Also in true end of term style the rooms are a mess - we're in **MR2 (SUHQ) from 12pm Saturday - 5pm Saturday**, and then **B2.02 (Science Concourse) for the rest of it**. Don't let that put you off though - it'll still be an excellent 34 hours of drop-in gaming! There's even a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/355632385026643/), wow. And there's posters at the bottom of the newsletter for both of these events! Double wow.\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nBoardgames is getting special treatment by having twice as many rooms as usual, wow! Unfortunately B2.03 is quite small but we'll have LIB2 from 5pm to deal with the inevitable lack of space.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, **B2.03 Science Concourse + LIB2 from 5pm**\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n\r\nFor your RPG needs, please check out the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) as always. Tim isn't running a weekly one-shot this week (gasp) as he's gonna be at the Build Your Own Board Game event. Which you should be at too! It's gonna be cool.\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nLife carried on, and events were still well-attended despite tabletop weekend (apparently everyone has an insatiable hunger for boardgames that wasn't sated by the weekend, huh). Superfight was played leading to excellent characters such as a whale that died in water (and was also a pi\u00f1ata), a mega-cactus with a dragon as one of its legs, a gorilla armed with a livestock-throwing catapult and of course, Sticky Canada (which could throw ninja stars). Sticky Canada, to confirm, is literally just Canada, but very sticky. And it had the ability to throw ninja stars???\r\n\r\nI brought in a new game this week called Tomatomato by the same people as Deep Sea Adventure (a very good submarine game... I quite like submarine games it seems) that involves pronouncing particularly long nonsense words. All you have to do is read the words on the cards in order. Easy, right? I've included one below (annotated with the words as they're hard to read in the photo), try to pronounce it quickly without making a mistake:\r\n\r\n![potatotomamamatomatomatototomatotomatomatomatomamato](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/tomatomato.jpg)\r\n\r\nThat's potatotomamamatomatomatototomatotomatomatomatomamato, by the way. I hope you pronounced it correctly! Finally, I forgot to put the exec meeting minutes from week 5's meeting in last week's newsletter, so you can find them [on our site](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/258/). Continuing the trend of things that weren't in last week's newsletter there are also photos from Tabletop Weekend at the bottom of this newsletter for you to enjoy!\r\n\r\nMuch love <3\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\nDiscord Shortlink: `xdDZnYQ`\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n[Our Sponsors, Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n![Quiz](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/tt_quiz_2_small.png)\r\n![Tabletop Weekend](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/tabletop-weekend-2-2-small.png)\r\nPosters for our upcoming events by our resident artist Ares!\r\n\r\n![Deception](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/tt-weekend-2-1.JPG)\r\nA huge game of Deception!\r\n\r\n![Root](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/tt-weekend-2-2.JPG)\r\nRoot, featuring the most adorable cat meeples and the most smug lizard meeples.\r\n\r\n![Roleplaying](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/tt-weekend-2-3.JPG)\r\nA roleplaying game featuring cards and an iPad as DM??\r\n\r\n![Through The Ages](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/tt-weekend-2-4.JPG)\r\nThrough The Ages, featuring many tiny cubes (but not as many as Siderial...)\r\n\r\n![Two Rooms](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/tt-weekend-2-5.JPG)\r\nTwo Rooms and a Boom, in which Callum probably told a funny joke, I don't know, I was in the other room at the time.\r\n\r\n![Two Rooms 2](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/tt-weekend-2-6.JPG)\r\nThe reveal at the end of Two Rooms, where one team very much knew that they'd won...",

      "body": "I love democracy! Before we begin, an advert from our partners at Tabletopopolis News:\r\n\r\n![WANTED: COMMS OFFICER](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/news-ad.png)\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n### Annual General Meeting (6pm Wednesday, LIB1)\r\nWelcome back to **Fun Facts About The AGM**, the show about facts being fun and fun being facts. I'm afraid this is our final episode (what with the AGM being **this Wednesday** and all), but we've got a **triple**-fact episode ending with our most fun fact yet! You can't say that we don't treat you. Our first fun fact (or I guess stressful fact) is that some of the exec positions still aren't filled, with Comms Officer remaining unfilled along with other positions. I'd really, really recommend running - talk to existing exec members if you're interested in their role! Nominations can be posted [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/253/), although you can run on the day.\r\n\r\nThe second fun fact is that currently you can propose amendments to motions proposed before on [this forum thread](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/261/)! You only have until **Tuesday 26th February 6pm** (that's tomorrow) to do this though, so I'd recommend having a read through of the motions soon.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's time for our most fun fact yet, the cream of the crop, the best fact we could pull out of the metaphorical bag of facts. This fact was in fact conceived weeks ago but has been saved for this special edition. So, here goes: AGM stands for \"ahh!!! general meeting!\" which is also the noise I'll make if not enough people turn up. Please turn up! Seriously, this meeting is so important for the society's future and we also have some incentives - we've just got in the board games Millennium Blades and Rollplayer from our sponsors [Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/) which will be available to try before the AGM and we also got some leaflets for discounted board games to give out!\r\n\r\nThat concludes this year's series of **Fun Facts About The AGM**. Here's your last reminder of the Facebook event, found [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/528557110974732/). I hope you've had fun learning about the many facets of the AGM and I hope to see you there! [outro music plays for the last time]\r\n\r\n### The Termly Quiz (OC0.01 Oculus Building, 6-8pm Friday 8th March)\r\nQuestions, prizes and more as the quiz returns with Ares still at the helm! We'll also have trophies provided by [The Pocket Workshop](https://thepocketworkshop.co.uk/) again - keep an eye out for more details about that soon. Also Callum is writing a round and after his beautiful MS Paint drawings and abstract art rounds I expect the third in the trifecta will not be one to miss! Finally in true social media style there's a Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/391081828349553/).\r\n\r\n### End of Term 2 Tabletop Weekend (12pm Saturday 9th March - 10pm Sunday 10th March, MR2 SUHQ and B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\nWhat would the end of term be without Tabletop Weekend? A sad, gameless husk where you'd like have to be productive or something I don't know. Let's not dwell on that, because it'd be awful regardless. Thirty four hours of gaming! The rooms may be a mess (**MR2 (SUHQ) from 12pm Saturday - 5pm Saturday**, and then **B2.02 (Science Concourse) for the rest of it**), other things may be a mess, but there'll always be the reassuring warmth of gaming with friends. Oh wait, that might just be the radiator, lemme turn that down... Anyway, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/355632385026643/)!\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nLook it's the AGM okay, get the hint. Boardgames will be interrupted by the meeting but is still mostly running, and all the other events are running as normal:\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, LIB1 (Library Ground Floor) **hint: the same place as the AGM**\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n\r\nFor your RPG needs, please check out the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) as always. Tim's weekly one-shot is up [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/93/) and another one-shot called The Peran Acquisition should be updated soon - I'm informed that it'll be moving time/date as to not clash with the AGM, so keep your eyes peeled for that. Wait, that's a terrible phrase, please don't peel your eyes that would really hurt.\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nThis weekend was the game jam with the Game Design society! We started strong with talks by Dan Ilett (Game Design President) and myself about boardgame design, and then went into the actual game making! Lots of cool games were made on the theme of space, which was mostly interpreted as, well, space, but some people interpreted it as space! Also some people didn't interpret it at all. I've added many pictures of the games made, which included: a dexterity based wargame where all of the spaceships are Jenga towers and you flick dice at them to attack (by me); a space exploration game where you explore for items while trying to avoid the dreaded Final ~~Destination~~ Encounter (by Alex (of Pocket Workshop fame) and Jack Dixon); a super Ludo game where you could buy more dice (by Henry Smith); and a game about giving your children space (by Alex Malte). That's not even all of the games - there were a few incomplete ones and ones that I didn't get photos of! All of these games are coming to a boardgaming session near you!

      "body": "[We pan to a job interview in a small, dark room with an interviewer sitting opposite a familiar figure. The interviewer is short, relatively short hair, wearing an oversized jumper. They look incredulously at some papers while sat on a throne of five shark toys. The figure is tall and wearing a purple hoodie, grasping a single shark toy.]\r\n**Interviewer**: So, you're the new secretary, huh?\r\n**Finnbar**: You got me, detective.\r\n**Interviewer**: No I'm an interviewer, get it right. Regardless, I've got a few questions for you.\r\n**Finnbar**: But I just won an election, I've earned this position.\r\n**Interviewer**: Not until I say you have, punk. Now, describe yourself in three words.\r\n[Finnbar thinks for a moment, their brow furrowed. Tension rises.]\r\n**Finnbar**: Confused, panicked, relatable.\r\n[The interviewer stares right at Finnbar. They pause.]\r\n**Interviewer**: You're hired!\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n### The Termly Quiz (OC0.01 Oculus Building, 6-8pm Friday)\r\nWeek nine is finally here and oh no I've got so many deadlines... well they're going to have to wait because the quiz is on the horizon. It's our usual conundrum-based affair with ridiculous quiz rounds and excellent prizes (including some familiar-looking trophies from [The Pocket Workshop](https://thepocketworkshop.co.uk/)) - I've been asked to keep Callum's round secret but it's very, very good, and there's even a round from me. Madness. Hype yourself up (and tell your friends) via signing up to this [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/391081828349553/), if that's your thing.\r\n\r\n### End of Term 2 Tabletop Weekend (12pm Saturday - 10pm Sunday, MR2 SUHQ and B2.02 Science Concourse)\r\nDon't let the mad rooms put you off - this is absolutely the place to be spending your weekend! Featuring class acts such as boardgames and tabletops, Tabletop Weekend is the prime choice for ~~procrastinating~~ thirty four hours of fun gaming times! We'll be in **MR2 (SUHQ)** from midday to 5pm on the Saturday, and **B2.02 (Science Concourse)** for the rest of the time - here's a useful flowchart to help:\r\n\r\n![Tabletop Weekend Flowchart](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/flowchart-tt-weekend.png)\r\n\r\nAlso there's a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/355632385026643/).\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nLARP has changed rooms as the Tabletop Weekend will be in B2.02 on Sunday, but otherwise things are the same. Except there's no AGM stopping board games, which is definitely a success.\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, LIB1 (Library Ground Floor)\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** Sunday 12:00 to 17:00 starting in B2.04 Science Concourse\r\n\r\nAs always, the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) is your friend when it comes to RPGs - currently Tim's usual one shot isn't up, but I'm sure it will be soon enough!\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nJust in case you'd not noticed *all of the advertising* and the bit where we talked about the society for three hours during boardgames, we had the AGM last week. Many (many) motions were proposed, amended and generally debated, and the new exec were installed like a bittersweet software update, sadly saying goodbye to those exec ending their term [Editor's Note: what]. Fortunately we have a new exec for you, who are as follows:\r\n\r\nCallum Marvell - President\r\nBenjamin McRae - Treasurer\r\nFinnbar Keating - Secretary\r\nJoshua Smith - Boardgames Rep\r\nJon Cheah - New New New Rob (Wargames Rep)\r\nDaniel Grieve - Draft Rep\r\nAlisdair Kidd - CCGs Rep\r\nJonathan Bell - RPG Rep\r\nThomas Bruce - Web Admin\r\nTimothy Smith - Quartermaster\r\nJakub Hajdus - LARP Rep\r\nLuke Scriven (In absentia) - Comms Officer\r\n\r\nThe biggest thanks go to the existing exec for their hard work this term, with special thanks going to two exec in particular. James Sampson-Foster, our Returning Officer for the AGM and Wargames Rep for five years is stepping down after a long term of posting \"hey, it's that time again\" week after week, his words echoing the halls of the Wargames Facebook Group like a friendly ghost (and like other work too of course, just that's an important part of his legacy). Nigel Heathcote also deserves thanks as our loyal President for three years now, being an excellent face of the society and getting a lot done.\r\n\r\nMany motions were also debated, leading to a number of constitution changes as we try to cut it down slightly, but more importantly a new mascot was elected, the inimitable Timothy Hutchinson. It is a very well-deserved title - he's a wonderful member of the society and Timforce, running his weekly D&D one-shots and always being around to help at events (and eat the spare food...) even though he's not an exec member!\r\n\r\nOther motions discussed included the lending of LARP gear, roles on the Discord server, new appointed exec roles (Graphic Design Officer and Holiday Rep), @Timforce on Discord and being clearer about how exec meetings work. To put the last point into action, a reminder - **any member can attend our exec meetings**! If you'd like to be there to discuss a certain point or would like your concerns discussed, simply talk to a member of exec - they will let you know where the meeting is or will bring your thoughts forward. James Sampson-Foster has written up the AGM in full, and you can find the notes for this [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/190LjlW2-bH72oIoeQ_1eHYq2e0NweA7_/view).\r\n\r\nIn non-AGM news, we played the games bought from [Zatu](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)! Millennium Blades has heavy money and I love it. Each Millennium Dollar bill is actually ten pieces of paper attached together and it's ridiculous. Rollplayer was also played and some crazy characters were concocted, as pictured below. Zatu have also posted a blog post about us, which you can find [here](https://www.board-game.co.uk/warwick-university-society/). Finally, I've been informed that in a Magic game, a player took 3 x 2^23 (that's 25165824) damage because of some mad creature that doubles its power per successive head in a coin toss, and someone got very, very lucky. You can be as lucky as that coin - just comment \"stay strong, coin\" in the Facebook comments, otherwise you'll be cursed for like six years or something.\r\n\r\nMuch love <3,\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\nDiscord Shortlink: `xdDZnYQ`\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n[Our Sponsors, Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n![Fred-Rick](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/rollplayer.jpg)\r\nThe Human Thief Fred-Rick, who is quite a good character by the looks of it!",

      "body": "So I'm ridiculously busy for the next few days but that fortunately gives me the perfect excuse to try out my newsletter intro generating robot! I fed a Markov Chain every intro to the newsletter written by me, and the results... exist. It's called FarBinn because it's trash. Take it away, FarBinn!\r\n\r\n\tI hope you with this is a great news reporting friend mentioned I'm Finnbar the new Comms Officer, and Bar! runs off your feet and Bar last week as John!\r\n\tInterviewer: No time for the whirring of Many Things except this week!\r\n\tCEO: It's fish bread.\r\n\tNews Man: Hello everyone!\r\n\tInterviewer: So, introducing Finn and other humans stuck in sight.\r\n\tAfter some fun gaming, even though R.O.N was a leg.\r\n\tFinnbar: Write a crooked witch's hat and if you're joining us for this week's events in the Superfight deck right now so sorry.\r\n\tSheriff: ...d ...do you all the same time every tree is cold wind passes through the tree!\r\n\tNigel: Fancy seeing you forget a longer intro this is the start with exams probably looming but if you have around, and if you with this week and welcome to your toes, we make...

Big Warhammer, big armies, big fun. I'll admit I don't know much about this, but if you've got a large amount of Warhammer and want to play Apocalypse, have a look on the Wargames Facebook Group for [this post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WarwickWargames/permalink/2314051048626437/) arranging a huge, 3000 point game. Please comment there if you're interested!\r\n\r\n### Watch The Skies Megagame (TBA, after exams)\r\nAfter my rousing (read: nervous) speech at the AGM where I mentioned that Callum and I wanted to run a megagame, we're actually starting to plan it! Callum has put up a very short (two multiple choice questions) survey for you to show your interest - please do it if you've not already! It can be found as a Google Form [here](https://goo.gl/forms/PK21Z09uOpSCskA43). There's a useful video linked in the form if you're not sure what a megagame is, which I'd recommend watching if you're curious!\r\n\r\n## What's happening this week?\r\nIt's week ten, which means no LARP sadly, but everything else is still running!\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Monday 17:00 to 22:00, B2.01 Science Concourse\r\n* **Magic: The Gathering Draft** Tuesday 18:00 to 22:00, B2.02 Science Concourse\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesday 14:00 to 22:00, LIB1 (Library Ground Floor)\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursday 17:00 to 22:00, R0.12 Ramphal Building\r\n* **Live Action Roleplaying** is not running this week!\r\n\r\nAs always, the [Events Page](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/events/) is your friend when it comes to RPGs, although given that it's the end of term I expect you won't find any more one-shots there.\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nThis week wars were hammered, magic was gathered, games were boarded and roles were played, as written during the bonus round by Patrick's team in the quiz. But yeah, the quiz! The team called The Ruiners won as they managed to answer questions about round things, things that sound like things but aren't the things in the picture, IKEA tables, video game music played questionably on trombone, music videos with no sound and blatant lies. They won trophies shaped like our logo provided by [The Pocket Workshop](https://thepocketworkshop.co.uk/) and a host of other cool prizes. Ryan (who was in The Ruiners) then managed to roll 6d8 + 12d6 + 7 in an RPG session, reaching a ridiculous total of 103 damage without spending any spell slots, which is quite mad. It was apparently his lucky weekend, huh?\r\n\r\nHe didn't manage to win the most important round though, which was of course the bonus round written by Callum and myself. All you had to do was fill in the blanks from excerpts of the newsletter. What did I say in that one week after the word \"the\"? Apparently nobody knows, with Patrick's team (that I can't remember the name of) reaching the dizzying heights of two points and winning on the tiebreaker round. They earned a pack of Space Top Trumps and a pack of Wine Gums, which are an excellent pair of prizes.\r\n\r\nIt was also Tabletop Weekend, featuring greats such as Dinosaur Island with the Totally Liquid expansion adding some really cool water dinosaurs. Unfortunately Nathan wasn't playing so there's not another newspaper article, but I expect that's because he's likely been banned from owning a dinosaur island after [the last time](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/newsletters/15). Also I got to play Armada with Jon (our new Wargames rep) for the first time and it's really cool, I'd recommend giving it a go because honestly it's kind of mad and I love it. Otherwise many other games were played including Two Rooms and a Boom at the much more reasonable hour of 11pm, ushering in a new era of games not being at stupid o'clock in the morning. Or probably not, let's be honest, the tabletop extravaganza next term will likely have many games at that kind of time. Thanks go especially to our new Boardgames Rep Josh for doing the overnight shift!\r\n\r\nGigante Computers in Cannon Park have started to stock Warhammer, and have everything at 10% off! They're also offering an extra 5% off with the code `SHADOWSPEAR3104` until what they advertise as April 31st, so if you're wanting some Warhammer get in on that before the aforementioned fictional date. There's more details in this [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WarwickWargames/permalink/2311624185535790/). We also had an exec meeting with both the new and old exec and a lot of things were discussed, including the events of last weekend, appointing exec, and much handover stuff - the minutes can be found [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/265/)!\r\n\r\nFinally, next week's newsletter (the Easter Holidays one) will be my last at the helm! So please tune in next week for one final newsletter by me before our new Comms Officer Luke takes over!\r\n\r\nMuch love <3,\r\nFinnbar Keating (Communications Officer)\r\nf.keating@warwick.ac.uk\r\n[Society Website](http://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/)\r\n[Society Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/TAGAROPLE/)\r\nDiscord Shortlink: `xdDZnYQ`\r\n[Board Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/681573368568623/)\r\n[Card Games Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/195335593904501/)\r\n[Wargames Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/276814799016749/)\r\n[LARPs Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204222674/)\r\n[RPG Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/136276596998520/)\r\n[Our Sponsors, Zatu Games](https://www.board-game.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n![Quiz winners](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/gallery_photos/quiz-2019-mar.jpg)\r\nThe winners of this term's quiz, The Ruiners!\r\n\r\n![Armada](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/armada.jpg)\r\nArmada, in which I regret my life decisions (the two big ships are Jon's and most of the rest are mine.)\r\n\r\n![Dice heart](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/diceheart.jpg)\r\nIt's a heart made of dice!",

      "body": "It's come to the end of my reign with my final newsletter... but wait! My class ability as a Communications Officer gives me the ability to write an extra d8-1 newsletters! Come on dice, be my friend this one time, let's roll.\r\n\r\n[They roll a 1.]\r\nOh no\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n### Hoodies, Badges and Statuettes\r\nWith the new exec coming in, we're going to be running another hoodie order soon so that the new exec can get their shiny exec hoodies. We'll be opening the order to everyone else as well though, so if you missed your chance to get a society-branded portable hug, you'll get another chance to soon! We'll also be offering badges of various kinds (which are in the process of being designed) to show off your love of the society and so that the exec don't have to wear hoodies in the middle of May. Finally, we'll be doing an order for statuettes of our logo just like the trophies from the quiz, although unfortunately you can't buy the feeling of satisfaction of winning the quiz. Both these and the badges are from [The Pocket Workshop](https://thepocketworkshop.co.uk/), who seem to suddenly be branching out big time in a very exciting way! Keep an eye out for all of those orders, coming to an SU website near you.\r\n\r\n### Watch The Skies Megagame (Thursday 20th June)\r\nNow that we've seen enough interest and have worked out what rooms are available, the date for this game of epic proportions has been set! End the academic year in style by playing world leaders, press and aliens as you try to work out what is going on in 2025. Nigel has been quoted as saying \"it sounds like a murder mystery, except the person being murdered is the Earth\", and if that doesn't get you playing it I don't know what will. This will be a ticketed event, so watch this space for news on how to purchase those. Finally, if you are still unsure about what a megagame even is, I recommend you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN71v9H_gg8) which shows a version of the exact game we'll be running.\r\n\r\n## What's happening over the holiday?\r\nTerm being over doesn't mean that our events are also over! We have a smaller but still great offering of holiday events for everyone still around over the Easter break, which are as follows:\r\n\r\n* **Wargames** Mondays 17:00 to 22:00, WA0.15a Westwood Avon Building\r\n* **Boardgames** Wednesdays 16:00 to 22:00, WA0.15a Westwood Avon Building\r\n* **Casual Card Games** Thursdays 17:00 to 22:00, WA0.15a Westwood Avon Building\r\n\r\nI hope you like WA0.15a! Otherwise all my bookings are in vain, much sadness. Here's a helpful map of where it is:\r\n\r\n![WA0.15a Map](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/static/wa015a.png)\r\n\r\n## What happened last week?\r\nThere was an Apocalypse tournament, with Team Falchion winning a decisive victory! Well, a decisive democratic victory - after an extremely dramatic turn where the Falchion team's largest unit was almost one-shot, everyone voted on a new rule that Team Falchion won if they killed the unit that one-shot Falchion's largest unit... and then promptly killed said unit, whoops. As was said by Nigel, it was the \"most one-sided apocalypse I've ever seen, and I've been in 12\". Photos can be found on the Wargames Facebook Group [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=oa.2323929544305254).\r\n\r\nIn other news, I went to Magic Draft for the first time ever, and I came dead last... but still had a good time! Alex was the overall winner with his mad deck that was sort of three colours but also sort of wasn't. Regardless, in my games against him I threw every bit of damage at him that I could... and then watched as he doubled his life total and halved mine with one card. Magic is a bit crazy sometimes, huh. I'd absolutely recommend trying out Draft to beginners - I have very little Magic experience but still had fun building a (bad) deck.\r\n\r\nCasual Card Games had a huge turnout this week with Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh and Netrunner all being played. I'd obviously not had enough of drafting for the week as the Netrunner community played a team draft, where you draft and build decks in pairs. The winning team was Tim and Cara, although it was extremely close with the differences in scores only being one point. Most importantly though, some very silly decks were built and much extremely casual fun was had. I even got to do stupid commentary for the final game and had a wonderful time. Anyway, if you'd ever like to try Netrunner, please come and say hi - we'd love to teach you!\r\n\r\nFinally, the exec had one more meeting to end the term, and I had to run and minute it as Ares' trial by fire for me as new Secretary. You can find the minutes on our website [here](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/forum/thread/266/), which featured discussion including (but definitely not limited to, given that it was two hours again) badges, megagames and a little more handover stuff.\r\n\r\n## The Sentimental Bit\r\nAs I mentioned last week, this is my last newsletter, and because of that I'm allowed to get a little sentimental, tough luck. Over the last year I've had the chance to write thirty four newsletters about all of the wonderful things that have happened in this society, from ridiculous owners of dinosaur islands to RPGs about hallucinatory desserts to accidentally cannibalistic aliens in outer space. And I've enjoyed every minute of it. I was considering making a clip show joke containing the best bits from the last three terms, but I honestly couldn't choose what to include because I've had so much fun writing all of these.\r\n\r\nThe newsletter, however, would not be what it is today without the people that read it. I'm so grateful for the enjoyment people have got out of the newsletter and all of the ridiculous things that people have done. My job has basically been retelling all of the wonderful stories from our events, and that's really fun - I'm honoured to have been your Communications Officer this year. I hope these newsletters have been nice little interruptions to your Monday (or Tuesday whoops) and that you've enjoyed them even a fraction of how much I've enjoyed writing them. So, thank you so much for reading! I'm really excited to see where our incoming Communications Officer Luke takes the future newsletters, and I hope that I'll do a good job as your new Secretary!\r\n\r\n[Finnbar stands up from their chair and turns off the Tabletop Society Newsletter Sending Machine, its quiet hum silenced after a brief moment.

      "body": "<h2>Announcements</h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"color: red\"><strong>Website state</strong>: This is the local site. DO NOT CONFUSE THIS AS LIVE!.</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Discord</strong>: We have a Discord! You can find it using the code <code>xdDZnYQ</code> in the Discord app or on the Discord site.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>About Us</h2>\r\n<p>We are the Warwick Tabletop Games and Roleplaying Society, and as the name suggests, we are the main source for everything tabletop gaming and roleplaying related. This includes board games, card games, and wargames as well as all sorts of RPGs; both the pen & paper sort, as well as live action. Our society is a combination of many smaller societies which each supported one of these activities. This allows us to run a wide range of events every week, and since many members are active in multiple areas of the society, we have a strong sense of community.</p></p>\r\n\r\n<strong>What we do:</strong>\r\n<p>We are one of the most active societies on campus, with regularly scheduled events running 6 days a week. These include live action roleplaying, tabletop roleplaying, wargames, board games, and card games. So whether you are only interested in, or have the time for, one of these or want to experience everything we have to offer we would love to see you at our events.</p></p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Wargaming</strong>\r\n<p>Our weekly Wargaming event runs every Monday (even outside of term time!) in which we simulate war through the use of custom built and painted miniature soldiers. This ranges from small scale skirmishes to planet wide battle, using a range of games systems. Regularly played games you can expect to see include: Age of Sigmar, Warhammer 40,000, Warhammer Fantasy 9th edition, Warmahordes, X-wing, as well as Dropzone and Dropfleet Commander. But don\u2019t worry if you have a preferred games system that isn\u2019t there, we are always happy to try out a new wargame. We also have a collection of society armies covering most of these systems allowing anybody to turn up a play!</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Magic: The Gathering booster draft</strong>\r\n<p>Every Tuesday evening during term time we run our weekly Magic: The Gathering booster draft. This will normally be the current draft set and costs \u00a38 per player (\u00a32 less for every pack that you supply yourself). If you already play Magic you will no doubt be all over this event. For newer players, we recommend that you come along to casual card games on Thursdays (more about that below) to get a grasp of the game and meet our great community. However, once you feel confident with the game, booster draft is the best way to get into competitive play \u2013 you don\u2019t need a collection of cards to play, and you\u2019ll be growing your collection for other competitive formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Board Games</strong>\r\n<p>By far our most popular event of the week, board games happens every Wednesday. We have a massive collection of board games. It doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re looking for: short punchy games that can be played in 30 minutes? Sure. Games of grand strategy that require many hours to play? Absolutely. If it could be described as a board game, we have a community willing to give it a shot. Due to the drop in nature of this event we welcome people to come along whenever they like for as long as they like, as there are always people ready to play. It\u2019s also the perfect place for you to bring any board game you have that you\u2019ve been itching to play, as we are always excited to play new games.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Casual Card Games</strong>\r\n<p>On Thursdays we get together to play the many varieties of card games available including; Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Android Netrunner. This allows people to learn new games, test new decks they have been working on for up and coming competitive events, or just relax with the many casual formats available for these games.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Tabletop roleplaying</strong>\r\n<p>If you\u2019re a fan of dungeons and dragons-style tabletop RPGs, we run campaigns every Saturday. We have team of games masters who run games in many systems, and we are always looking for more if you fancy running a campaign yourself. Due to the long nature of roleplaying games these can run throughout the term, so be sure to check the forums at the start of term to make sure you get to play in the game you are interested in as spaces fill up fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Live action roleplaying (LARP)</strong>\r\n<p>Every Sunday during term time we run our weekly LARP adventure overseen by our extremely knowledgeable LARP refs. The weekly LARP adventures are the most physically active events we run as a society, and involve donning armour and robes to do actual battle with our LARP weapons. But it\u2019s not all about combat, as there are plenty of non-combat encounters devised to allow you to fully live out your characters\u2019 experiences. But don\u2019t worry: if that sounds like a daunting task, our regular members are very friendly and happy to help you get into the system. We even have a massive selection of society costumes and weapons, so all you have to do is come along!</p>",

We keep this data secure and do not share it, and will let you know if this or the Policy itself changes.\r\n\r\n**Last Updated**: 3rd July 2018\r\n\r\n## About This Policy\r\nWarwick Tabletop Games and Roleplaying Society (\u201cus\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, or \u201cour\u201d) operates https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk/. This policy informs you, a user of our site, regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information received from users of this site.\r\n\r\nBy using this site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance of this policy.\r\n\r\n## Information Collection and Use\r\nWhile using this site, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to identify or contact you. The main personal data we collect is your email address, which is used to attribute an account to you for password recovery. This is the minimum personal data we require from you to create an account. This data may also be used in future to contact you as detailed in the Communications section.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, any personal data posted publicly on the site (e.g. in our forums, events system, user bio or messages) is collected by us. This is done so that we can provide that data to you and other users in future as the message or post it was contained in, and for no other purpose. You may optionally provide your name to help other users identify you, and if you do so we also collect this information for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is your responsibility to keep this data up to date if it changes so that we can keep in contact (email address) and provide the correct information to you and others (keeping your name up to date, for example). By default, we keep your personal data permanently; however, it can be deleted by contacting us at the email address at the end of this policy.\r\n\r\nWe will never release this data to any third parties. Only the Data Controller (the \u201cWeb Admin\u201d) may access this data.\r\n\r\n## Log Data\r\nLike many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site (\"Log Data\"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other statistics.\r\n\r\nThis data is used in aggregate statistics compiled by the site\u2019s host, [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com), so falls under their Privacy Policy. Since we do not run any advertising, this data is shared with no third party trackers.\r\n\r\n## Communications\r\nWe may use your Personal Information to contact you about changes to this Policy. We may in future use this data to send promotional material or newsletters. Furthermore, like many other sites, we may contact you for password recovery - this is a one-time communication designed to attribute you to your account.\r\n\r\nWe may in future send opt-in email notifications for events, messages, and forum threads set by you.\r\n\r\n## Cookies\r\nCookies are files with a small amount of data and possibly a unique anonymised identifier used to improve the browsing experience. These cookies are stored by your browser in your hard drive, and act to identify you so that you do not have to login on every page you browse. You may set your browser to refuse cookies; however, if you do, some sections of the site may not work. In agreeing to this Policy cookies will be used unless you explicitly disable their use by your browser.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\nThe security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\r\n\r\nIf there is a breach of security, we will identify users as soon as we detect it ourselves. We have taken steps such as hashing and salting passwords to reduce the impact of a breach if there is one.\r\n\r\n## Changes to this Policy\r\nThis policy is effective as of 14th July 2018, and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future (detailed in the next paragraph), which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.\r\n\r\nWe reserve the right to change this Policy, and if you continue to use this service after the effective date of a new version of this Policy, we will assume that you agree to the new policy. You will be notified of any changes to this policy one week before the effective date of the changes.\r\n\r\n## Contact Us\r\nIf you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us.
